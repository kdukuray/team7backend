I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.", "date_posted": "2024-02-15", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung+galaxy+s24+ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung+galaxy+s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 134, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 2, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRL92WVBP7CLK/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "A Powerhouse with Stunning Display, Sleek Design and Exceptional Camera Quality:I've been using the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra for about two months now, and it's been a fantastic experience so far.

At a minimum it takes great pictures and video. The screen is a great size for people with average to large hands. At first glance it looks like a standard ultra model its big, orbital lens separation, sturdy, bezel with a sleek design. I have been a Samsung fan since the galaxy line up started and practically owned every model out there to test and see which one is practical me the average joe. If you a minimalist this might not be the phone for you. This has the latest tech and probably will be overwhelming for you. This is due to the endless features that it has. If you are a gamer and have several hrs to kill on your favorite Mobile game this will meet your needs and then some. If you are that person that has been a Samsung note fan than this is the phone for you. If you're a movie junkie this will def suit your needs, when you're on a break from work or just hanging out. The color details are great especially in 4k. With this being said there are some quirks that i did not know existed and will pass it on to everyone. The s24 ultra has some drawbacks if you are purchasing it directly through Samsung. Your video calling will not work on with carriers - the reason for this Samsung does not have to voip it's a software according to Samsung. This is when you go to your contacts, and you have the option for video calling. This apparently cannot be put on by your carrier as they will deny trying to add it.(Samsung blamed the carrier , the carrier blamed Samsung) After several back-and-forth conversations Samsung told me to download a 3rd party app to allow me to video call. Other providers told me they could not help me. Now would you want to tell all of your contacts to download a 3rd party app and you would have to ask yourself \"would you do it for one person?\". Moving on to text messages and multimedia. You would normally be able pictures direct to people where it would show on the receiver's messages. But instead, it will send them a link that would expire in a certain time frame. They will then have to click to download the image to their phone. My question would be, how annoying that has to be every time i send someone a picture. They have to go through a ring of fire just to see the image or video. I have also asked about this with carriers they have stated, you guessed it go with a third-party app.  to the upside the phone is great. Standard android system as they have always been great but with a lot more at your disposal. Gpu is exceptionally fast (doesn't feel laggy or buggy) Camera is outstanding have taken countless photos with it. Videos are not grainy as some cameras from the galaxy line up once were. The phone is unlocked from Samsung. Bluetooth is great, connects fast and easy. Graphics are great for this model (does not overheat like the previous models when gaming) Overall if you want a phone that does the job this can do it. But do not purchase it directly from Samsung, purchase it through your carrier to avoid the hassles and dragged-out conversations i have gone through. I hope this helps you make your decision a little bit clearer on how you want to proceed on a new phone. I am giving it 3 stars from the manufacture. There was no recourse rectifying a solution.

Before that I had a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus for 4 years, and before that was on iPhone since the iPhone 4. I don't play the android vs ios games, so if you're looking for that pointless narrative then go elsewhere. I'm writing this review to share my experience having throughly used both platforms.Apple has masterfully crafted a user experience that works just fine for most users. These people don't care about customizing or having an \"always on display\" that's actually always on. You have to be brainwashed not to admit that the iPhones AOD isn't really always on, no matter what settings you use. What iPhones has going for it is a finely tuned phone, texting, facetime, apple pay experience - things that make owning an iPhone convenient.What makes Android worth owning is the ability to use it how you wanted to use it instead of a corporation telling you you're \"holding it wrong.\" I enjoyed the galaxy s10. It had an excellent display, almost indistinguishable from the s24. My review will focus on the user experience/software of the S24, not the hardware. Hardware has gotten so powerful that most users will never need all that processing power.Samsung has failed to finely tune their software like Apple has. I liked s10's OneUI look - S24 is ugly in comparison. The stark blue and light grey quick menu has been replaced with an ugly \"Material You\" color pallet. You can download \"GoodLock\" and try to change the color palette, but countless things like transparency don't work with it. Bottom line is why I  would need to spend time trying to make it look decent if it's Samsung job considering the inflated price of these phones. So many things that should be included with the phone have been placed behind a paywall, forcing you to pay to get back what was part of OneUI in older versions.Another indication that Samsung isn't tuning its software is the fact that they gave up on their \"message\" app, now forcing you to use Googles message service, which is fine, but why bother having their own app if they never really committed to it?So many other system apps, Samsung has to confuse the user into deciding which platform to use. You will have double the apps for every single system app, again confusing the user into deciding in which service to commit to.I like Android, but I don't like Samsung. I don't see the point in spending a super premium price for a phone that's not fully committed to either own layer like ONEUI or Android. This has been the problem with Samsung phones since they released ONEUI. Either fully commit to your own version, or commit to stock Android - stop confusing consumers about what your product is about, and stop being scammy by holding back features behind a paywall.My recommendation for Android users is this: You don't need to pay a super premium price to get the Android experience. Today's budget phones are powerful enough to allow you to customize it according to your own liking.", "date_posted": "2024-10-14", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung+galaxy+s24+ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung+galaxy+s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 146, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 2, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6DQ86UQ1682/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Excellent:Bought this for my daughter for her 15th birthday.

I really like having the pen which is the main reason I got it.  It has  a cool feature that I use quite a bit where you can hold down the home button and it will analyze whatever is on the screen or whatever you are pointing your camera at and then show you web results.  Or you can circle something on the screen and it will search for that.  Or it will translate text on the screen which can be really useful.  I am particular about how my home screen looks so I really like the feature that can generate an ai picture and use the color palette from the picture to use for the phone theme colors and it can also automatically redo those gawdy standard android icons to ones that look nice with the current wallpaper.  I like the new messages app that works better with those pesky iphone users :). The camera is of course awesome as well as the zoom.  Speakers sound better than my old phone and the battery life is better too.What I dislike most is the sharp corners, they are uncomfortable even with a phone case on.

So this is old hat, you either love this phone for its S Pen or just go with something else. I use my phone and the pen to make grocery lists, to do lists, draw, edit photos, etc.Pros:-FLAT SCREEN IS BACK. HOLY COW, how I've hated those stupid curved edges, glad that flat is back. Just bring back MicroSD expansion as well. I would say bring back headphones but apparently Android 10 or later killed external mic support via the combo jack. So, that's useless. This was the MAJOR reason why I upgraded my S23 Ultra, no joke, now I can put actual screen protectors on it, don't have to worry about optical glue-on glass that you then cure with UV.Cons:-Love that you can't turn off really annoying unnecessary notifications like the DAILYWELLNESS nonsense, weekly usage reports, \"hey we turned these apps off since you're not using them\".-Love that the galaxy store now has push notification ads that you can't turn off in settings or in app. That's super cool. Save that crap for your GALAXY A lines that are budget oriented, not your professional S lines.-New S Pen, now most of the time, the S-Pens that come with these are SERVICEABLE at best, but for whatever reason, this year's is painful to use, could be old age kicking in at 36 or just a bad design. It's too thin and too square. Last year's was slightly wider. NEVER MIND, just compared them, they're basically the same, it's the fact that last years had a rubberized texture on it, where this year's is just plastic, that's why it hurts to use.Meh:-A lot of this is more the same incremental improvements; cpu is beefier, display is brighter and more betterer, s pen is faster, touch is faster, etc. THE BORING STUFF.Overall:You always take a gamble with Amazon's \"USED\" stuff, and was worried that I was going to get a bad one. I bought, USED VERY GOOD, which usually means cosmetic damage somewhere on the device, and then it was \"USED VERY GOOD, potentially without box\". Mine looked pristine, slapped a screen protector and case on it right away to keep it that way, and it came with a box. You buy this phone if Samsung and styluses are your jam. OTHERWISE there's no real reason to get this. When there are a lot of companies with the 8 Gen 3 out there for a lot cheaper and in smaller more manageable body sizes. Like the S23 Plus or S23 standard. The Titanium Gray color has a slight champagne/earthen quality to the gray that I kind of dig that's subtle and sort of classy.", "date_posted": "2024-04-09", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung+galaxy+s24+ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung+galaxy+s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 150, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 2, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C1TDKBSKR6T7/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "Refined to a very powerful practical tool:I had the S23 ultra but ran it over by accident. I don't see a huge difference with the S24 ultra. It has a good camera with a good zoom which is important to me. It's now a 5x analog zoom instead of a 10x like the S23 but I don't notice a huge difference when it comes to zooming probably because the CCD chip is better at 50 megapixels instead of 12. It also does more digital manipulation with the picture afterwards which sharpens and cleans things up when zooming way in. I don't remember the S23 doing as much after you take the shot. I also notice a little bit brighter image when less light but that's probably because the CCD chip is a little larger to capture more light than the S23 ultra when it uses the 5x zoom lens. The biggest difference I see is the titanium instead of aluminum shell and it's nicer, it feels classier in your hands. I know the big hoopla is AI at the moment and Samsung is marketing it front and center, but it doesn't really make a big difference in my mind because the S23 with a firmware update has most of those features anyway.

I haven't had any problems with it. Everything that you think that you got with an iPhone, you got more with this Samsung. And yes, I did spend a pretty penny on this phone. However I think it was totally worth it from the customizable to the AI being installed in it to having all the Samsung feelings that make it feel like an actual smartphone. I absolutely love it. Customization is the best part of this phone. I can change it, however I want to. It's the same with an iPhone but I feel like you can do so much more with this phone now. I will say that the best part about this was the gestures that I can use on this phone. Whenever I'm trying to use my previous iPhone because it still has all my information on it, I just can't do the gestures anymore and it makes me feel like, \"Oh, that's not working in my favor,\" so I say that that is one of the best qualities and the best parts of the phone. But overall, The appearance feels amazing. It is very easy to use. The battery life is questionable. Because I tried to run it from 6am-11am and it's already down to forty percent, so I don't know what the context is. Maybe it's my own battery, but it still lasts a long time if you're not using it 24/7. The condition of the phone whenever I first got it was It felt like I just bought it from the store.

I bought this phone based on the description that it was \u201cexcellent refurbished\u201d condition, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m giving this a 1-star rating: 1. Overheating Issues: The phone gets hot very quickly during basic use, even when just browsing or texting. It\u2019s uncomfortable to hold and concerning for long-term use. 2. Battery Life is Terrible: Despite the description claiming the battery was at 98%, the phone drains ridiculously fast. I can barely make it through a few hours before needing to charge again. For a phone advertised as \u201cexcellent,\u201d this is unacceptable. 3. Scuffed Camera: The camera has visible scuffs on it, making it seem like no effort was made to refurbish or inspect the phone properly before selling it. 4.

I brought it to two friends that also have S23 Ultras to unbox and get feedback. Immediately I noticed that I had ordered Green and received Lime which was disappointing but not a deal breaker since it would live in a case.It powered on and the screen seemed bright without any dead pixels or screen issues that I could see. I clicked the S Pen and it would not come out. My friends showed me theirs and they clicked out easily. It was at this point I noticed there was slight damage to the bottom corner housing of the phone that could have caused binding on the S Pen and was entirely unwilling to investigate further.I took a short video showing the condition of the phone, explaining the issue, demonstrating it, and boxed it back up for return.

When smartphones became a thing, I like using the Samsung Galaxy Note line because the stylus always gave me an edge with an extra means to quickly jot down information.  I was sad to hear that they got rid of the Note line, but am very happy that they included the Stylus on the Ultra version of the Samsung Galaxy S23.  For those people who are unfamiliar the stylus allows you to take a quick note on the blank \"closed\" screen and has Bluetooth functionality that I personally use to activate the camera and take a photo.  Another added feature that not too many people seem to utilize is the DEX functionality.  This feature allows you to use your phone as a computer when you connect a Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse.  This is done (usually) by using a USB c to HDMI type adapter or dock.  This alone is amazing for me because I am able to use my phone as a dedicated desktop while traveling.  You can not use Windows or Apple programs as far as I know; you are limited to the apps that are available on the app store (both Google's and Samsung's).

I'm a ram head so I went for the 512 of storage just for that. Wished they offered that with the 256 version to save a few extra bucks but it'll be nice to have all this memory.The biggest and most amazing feature is the 10x optical zoom. I can't believe how good it is. The stabilization and quality is impressive and perfect.It's easy to use but for advanced users who theme it and change launchers, it's highly customizable which is why I go for Samsung and goodlock.Great buy. Happy to have spent all that money on a phone. Pairing it with an otterbox slim case and waiting ony new Mous case to come in.Go renewed. It saves money and is yet to disappoint.

The process can be troublesome for people who may not know what to do if they come across it.Overall, owning an iPhone for the first time has been a great experience, I was debating on getting the S24 Ultra from Samsung because I\u2019ve already owned one.

My wife on the other hand has an Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and likes Apple products. This is my first Apple smartphone. This review is about the condition of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max that I purchased from this seller. I will not say much about the smartphone itself as there are many other reviews on it.The seller advertised the item as renewed and in excellent condition. I received the smartphone in 4 days which was a nice surprise because the original estimated delivery date was 7-10 days. The iPhone package came in a plain white box (not the original Apple box) and included a generic lightning to USB-A charging cable. Nothing else is included. FYI, Apple did not include a charger with the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Out of the box, I inspected the item very carefully and up close. It looked just like brand new. Looking from closer than 12 inches, there were no scratches, dents, or nicks anywhere. I did find two very small paint chips on one corner edge of the outer steel frame. One paint chip was about 1/16 inch in size and the other was even smaller than that. From 12 inches away, the paint chips are barely noticeable but I can see them. A cell phone case will cover them up anyway so it's not an issue for me.I fully charged up the iPhone and turned it on. It booted up right away and I went through the setup process and connected it to my wi-fi router. I called my service provider, T-Mobile, and provided the necessary information to transfer the service to my new phone. I had a slight hitch where I could not make phone calls. I found out that I had to click setup in the cellular setting. Once I did that, I was connected to my service provider. Phone calls then went through without a problem. Also, I was able to pair my generic earplugs via Bluetooth very easily and quick.The renewed iPhone shows the battery health maximum capacity to be at 92% relative to when it was new. That is very good. Daily, I have used many apps, checked emails, made phone calls/texting, taken photos/videos, etc., and found minimal battery drainage. I can probably go a few days without recharging.The Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is bigger and heavier than my previous Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone so that is something you may consider if size and weight are an issue.All in all, I love the Apple iPhone Pro Max and I can say this is a good and honest seller.", "date_posted": "2024-06-30", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-128GB-Deep-Purple/dp/B0BN9P1GXC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2SGXO7PFXHMPE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QphN_BiRpyEcCWoUfCc4zkliqgrz21z7azzGk3CjyaD0Oj3xvnfMWk745OCQlq_5-XXfD7p9O25TfMO73C00pRALATdkx2ETFpSkUvt0wuzYikAz7wgehFyINpM1NWriLbgmxL40L4r8DlNH81njZu0Ml0dW5S3hPdrAuG4TZiHGvauVJIAaWeA-lkyYAFdNW4uXYiFl2hId8yVMoO0cLEIB973b3Q2KZ-2FY0-9iUk.idRIBjrs94wTzob6Qssk8wteh29ZKGzy3kHXkShL0mw&dib_tag=se&keywords=iphone+15+pro+max&qid=1734376971&sprefix=iphone+15+pro+max,aps,114&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Apple"}, {"id": 290, "product_name": "Apple iPhone 14", "product_id": 13, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OKI9Y2NADH8A/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BN9P1GXC", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "awesome, 100% recommend:this phone was in excellent condition, it was basically brand new. the battery health is at 100%, there\u2019s no scratches or dent or dings, i\u2019m extremely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend to a friend", "date_posted": "2024-12-09", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-128GB-Deep-Purple/dp/B0BN9P1GXC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2SGXO7PFXHMPE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QphN_BiRpyEcCWoUfCc4zkliqgrz21z7azzGk3CjyaD0Oj3xvnfMWk745OCQlq_5-XXfD7p9O25TfMO73C00pRALATdkx2ETFpSkUvt0wuzYikAz7wgehFyINpM1NWriLbgmxL40L4r8DlNH81njZu0Ml0dW5S3hPdrAuG4TZiHGvauVJIAaWeA-lkyYAFdNW4uXYiFl2hId8yVMoO0cLEIB973b3Q2KZ-2FY0-9iUk.idRIBjrs94wTzob6Qssk8wteh29ZKGzy3kHXkShL0mw&dib_tag=se&keywords=iphone+15+pro+max&qid=1734376971&sprefix=iphone+15+pro+max,aps,114&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Apple"}, {"id": 291, "product_name": "Apple iPhone 14", "product_id": 13, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU32X1DYAX6LL/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BN9P1GXC", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Looks good:It looks very new to me and the battery life is 88% but other than that I have tried it working good and it\u2019s worth the price you paid for it!", "date_posted": "2024-11-21", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-128GB-Deep-Purple/dp/B0BN9P1GXC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2SGXO7PFXHMPE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QphN_BiRpyEcCWoUfCc4zkliqgrz21z7azzGk3CjyaD0Oj3xvnfMWk745OCQlq_5-XXfD7p9O25TfMO73C00pRALATdkx2ETFpSkUvt0wuzYikAz7wgehFyINpM1NWriLbgmxL40L4r8DlNH81njZu0Ml0dW5S3hPdrAuG4TZiHGvauVJIAaWeA-lkyYAFdNW4uXYiFl2hId8yVMoO0cLEIB973b3Q2KZ-2FY0-9iUk.idRIBjrs94wTzob6Qssk8wteh29ZKGzy3kHXkShL0mw&dib_tag=se&keywords=iphone+15+pro+max&qid=1734376971&sprefix=iphone+15+pro+max,aps,114&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Apple"}, {"id": 292, "product_name": "Apple iPhone 14", "product_id": 13, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ECWVAO1A12K0/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BN9P1GXC", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "86% Battery health - no scratches:Phone is performing well, no scratches at all, battery is at 86% unfortunately but other than that the quality is good!

This isn't my first refurbished phone, but I'm always a little anxious spending the money on something I HOPE is going to be good (as opposed to brand-new/unused).I bought this phone in refurbished/excellent condition. After reading multiple reviews on multiple refurbished phone listings on Amazon, my biggest concern was (always is) getting one with a damaged screen, cameras, or having it not truly be unlocked. I've had this phone less than 24 hours, but here's my take SO far (I can't speak for other people, these are just my experiences):1) Yes, it was (for me) truly, 100% unlocked. Not even an ex-carrier logo when I first turned it on! (My previous 'unlocked' refurbished phone has a T-Mobile logo when turned on) I was quite happy/impressed about this.2) No scratches (that I could see) on the front/touchscreen. There are multiple, TINY scuffs on the sides (not part of the touchscreen)/top edge/bottom edge of the phone - which I fully expected w/ a refurbished phone, and I'm totally fine with it (and this is if I'm REALLY nitpicking - they're really not that bad, though. It's just not FLAWLESS, which - again - I'm fine with).3) 99% flawless on the backside - the ONLY thing I can see is a TINY scuff on the edge of one of the cameras (not the actual camera/glass screen itself), and this is cosmetic - it doesn't affect the quality of the camera (that I've noticed).4) S-Pen pops out like it should, seems to be fine.5) Charges just fine so far - both wireless and wired.6) Popped in my SIM card (US Mobile, uses T-Mobile network), and it worked instantly. No phone/SIM-related problems so far. Everything - and I mean everything (data, wallpapers, photos, Samsung Notes from my previous phone, sounds/ringtones, apps, folders, etc) - transferred from my old phone perfectly (Samsung Smart Switch app).7) Fingerprint reader works fine for me so far - and that's with a plastic-y (TPU?) screen protector that I put on it.I haven't noticed any real issues thus far - if anything changes, I'll update my review.OVERALL: For me, yes it's definitely worth the money. If you're considering it and you're on the fence (and I understand why you might be), I say go for it. I'm very satisfied, hopefully nothing changes in time. Buying refurbished is a great way (in theory, lol) to save money while still getting a phone you really want (I think they're normally way overpriced anyway). Shipping was great (got mine the next day!), no issues with packaging (very safe/secure), and the phone - while not literally FLAWLESS - still looks great, works great, and I look forward to using it for a long time to come! A great buy overall!", "date_posted": "2024-04-26", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DAHGKWPY2DMZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7JLUOsqO2pMLHLgTMRIdofuN07q38F1oGegdm45aT31hrFh9TClyZLOtAhRKbqWZ35n3tJWXvv6gd0r2bil1uJI67gKT_5pNypkNAwzrKbqcCgji2T8y2x-UfoM7a9MI7G24hCPpk6Wja2lMSOYXnbAwTPUrMsNLQScY5Gu6nbPUtNhNa74WLmzDBSJVIjHuOYApS1pO8VRPXuxIqtHvdYazi1I6twlEAcOLcm50Lig.ifdW4UZsmNzYzr-OOM46OpOmGGzucAZCRUdG1HS17Lc&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy+s22+ultra&qid=1734377870&sprefix=galaxy+s22+ultra,aps,83&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 336, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra", "product_id": 14, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MBMK4DK1O24M/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VD33WHW", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "4/5 - Charger doesn't work:Bought this because my phone died on a whim and needed a phone really bad.

Don't get me wrong, this thing is BADASS for the price I got it for!

I'm assuming the S Pen that came with the phone was an aftermarket pen or something. So in conclusion, if you run into the same issue, just buy a new S Pen from \"Samsung\" themselves! It fixed the issue for me!Shipping:Phone arrived immediately on the next business day (Monday), 3 days after ordering it (Friday).In the box:-Phone-Fast Adaptive Charger Base-Fast Charging CableUnboxing/ Initial Impression:Outstanding condition of the phone itself! Not a single scratch, not a single fingerprint (other than my own fingerprints after unwrapping it). The box came well-packaged, and inside of an envelope.SIM Installation:Now, I DO have to say..-I read another reviewers comment, saying that BEFORE installing the SIM card, one should UPDATE THE PHONE'S SOFTWARE until it no longer needs to update. Which I did. So, after it updated to December's latest software.. I installed the SIM card. Works flawlessly. Sent and received phone calls/ texts/ etc.S Pen:Pen works great!Final words:If you're thinking about it... DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. Get the phone!

Received yesterday. quick delivery. I opened it immediately, the delivery man was still in sight. It was off and at 14%. Packaged fine. It came with a block & cord don't know the wattage tho. The phone looked brand new BUT I thought two of cameras looked a little scuffed, taking pics looked fine, turned out two lens had old worn lens protectors on them is why it looked ugly lol (others lens had none), under them was pristine lens. I charged the phone. Actually a few times since yesterday I have charged it. Battery life seems to very bad but researching settings for improvements. Have changed many but still learning. The charging seems a lot slower time too vs my old 20+. It will say 2 or 3 hours but my 4 year old phone will say an hour on same cord with a low battery even etc. and it bleeds battery faster than my older phone. But again need to play with more settings maybe. Researching. Might be a s22 problem from my reading but this could be more I'm not sure yet. Video, sound quality & everything looks amazing. Love all the settings, ringtones even everything is better lol. WiFi. I love the s-pen. Seems to work. It's beautiful. But haven't tested everything but what I have seems new. No issues putting my phone card in or transfering all data. I put an OtterBox on it and screen protectors.

The s9 is obviously old but it worked well so I figured I'd buy a newer version for personal use after my iPhone I had for 8 years finally died.What I was looking for in a phone:[  ] Ability to make calls/texts[  ] A great camera as I am constantly traveling and in nature and I don't like carrying an extra camera[  ] A large interface to view the photos I take.A few details in the beginning-The below issues have been present since getting my phone. I have just now became frustrated enough to write a review.-I have never dropped my phone more than 3ish ft (from hand to ground while sitting or standing), what I'd sat is normal wear/tear. These issues DID exist before, though I don't think dropping an electric ever helps it. I've never gotten my phone wet, too hot, plugged in to a non GFCI protected outlet, or hooked up to another computer where a data transfer cord could have transmitted a virus.-I run a paid VPN and use Firefox and duckduckgo-I live in a very metropolitan area where proximity to my cell providers towers are not an issue-I have a nice case I have had on the phone since purchasing and a screen protectorIssues[  ] Answering phone calls: what I feel like happens most often is that when I attempt to answer an incoming call I press the green answer button. Then the  phone will stop ringing and bring up what I'll call the \"in-session call\" screen but it never truly connects. It will stay stuck on this screen with no one able to hear each other for up to a minute. I have talked to people in person (the one I was trying to communicate with) and they will tell me that they were sent to voice-mail.[  ] Placing phone calls: when trying to place phone calls, sometimes my phone will ring once then a recording will tell me the person I am trying to reach is unavailable or the number I am trying to reach is not in service. I knew that these two reasons were not valid before but I had an experience when needing to reach 911 where I was told the number was not in service. I have also verified this by sitting next to people I am trying to call and seeing that the call never goes through.[  ] Microphone crackles if playing outloud or on speaker and will continue making the crackling noise until phone is restarted[  ] Camera is just way less detailed than I thought it would be. I heard great things about the clarity before buying. And, when looking at the physical phone, seeing how many lenses there are on the outside, one would think this phone could produce some quality shots. But every photo I take seems pixelated. I have tried to narrow it down to a specific lens by tweaking zoom and frame but I have located it the fix. This may be a software issue as the lenses aren't scratched[  ] The autocorrect function is pretty lousy. One of the 3 options usually happens: 1, a word that is spelled correctly will be autocorrected to something that doesn't make contextual sense. 2, the correct correction will be made but it will be conjoined with the following word after typing. 3, a word is spelled wrong bybthe operator but autocorrect never pics it up. Funny enough, this example happened while typing the previous sentence. I left it just to provide example and put it into the attached media section on the review.[  ] Screenshots don't always show up immediately in your photos. The photo app may need to be closed out of first and reopened.[  ] Thumb print: huge issue here...it only works about half of the time. I have now just began putting my password in every time. This is a first world complaint, but if it is a function of the phone I bought, it should work more than half of the time.[  ] Trying to place the mouse in a specific place in a paragraph can be a nightmare. The sensitivity and touch technology for the screen seems cheap. I know this isn't the case but it can seem like it will place your mouse everywhere but where you want it. I have similar issues when trying to highlight a specific word/portion in text while making edits.Some good stuff[  ] The screen is very large and crystal clear. Samsung was able to utilize a really large portion of the front screen all the way to the literal edge The phone is great for watching videos[  ] The phone itself is very sleek and good-looking[  ] The battery life is surprisingly good. The lifespan does seem to fluctuate day to day as my usage usually consists of calling and text (no social media). If you reach 5% life though the phone has about 1-2 minutes left, unlike the iPhone which seems to vary.All in all, the first thing I would have done differently is to not buy refurbished. And secondly, in my very narrow experience, I think Apple makes a better product. The security on Apples devices is a HUGE selling point for me as well. I haven't had a security issue with this device, but I have tested the security of other android devices.", "date_posted": "2024-06-17", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DAHGKWPY2DMZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7JLUOsqO2pMLHLgTMRIdofuN07q38F1oGegdm45aT31hrFh9TClyZLOtAhRKbqWZ35n3tJWXvv6gd0r2bil1uJI67gKT_5pNypkNAwzrKbqcCgji2T8y2x-UfoM7a9MI7G24hCPpk6Wja2lMSOYXnbAwTPUrMsNLQScY5Gu6nbPUtNhNa74WLmzDBSJVIjHuOYApS1pO8VRPXuxIqtHvdYazi1I6twlEAcOLcm50Lig.ifdW4UZsmNzYzr-OOM46OpOmGGzucAZCRUdG1HS17Lc&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy+s22+ultra&qid=1734377870&sprefix=galaxy+s22+ultra,aps,83&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 342, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra", "product_id": 14, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16VHX0ZC88BD4/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VD33WHW", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Love it!

Anyway, love the phone!!!! and then all of the sudden...... the screen went black on me for no reason. It wasn't cracked or anything... so i thought, maybe it just died?  i didnt recall the battery being so low though.. well , even the charging circle didnt pop up when i plugged it in, BUT it vibrated. it also vibrated when i pulled the s pen out. ok, so the phone is on.... the screen isn't working... but why? there is no reason for the screen to be black... while attempting to unlock my old s10+ through Samsung mobile i , for whatever reason, clicked play sound to find my s22.. it didnt ring. why?!???! it is enabled to be found.. the location and everything was on. whats going  on? welllllllp. after trouble shooting and symptom checking i discovered that my motherboard is failing. and its a really common problem with the s22 ultra! so my favorite phone.... has a motherboard issue. I just hope i can get all of my data off of it, and i hope that everything is backed up. it flashed on for a few minutes and i synced back ups but I'm not sure it actually finished before the screen blacked out again, or if it continued while blacked out.. anyway, this really really sucks.

I've had it for a couple days now and I can say it was one of my better purchases.The phone arrived a day early, well packaged, and included the phone(w/37% battery charge), an adaptive fast charger, a cheap usb c charging cable, and sim removal tool. After close inspection, the phone showed no signs of prior ownership. It was in pristine condition just like new. It started right up and I got through the setup process. Being an unlocked phone,I figured I could just throw in my Cricket sim card and be ready to go. Cricket recognized the phone straight away, reminded me to turn on wireless calling, and I was back in business. Now let's get it charged up.I plugged in my OP6T usb c cable and powerpack out of habit and started messing with settings when I ran across the battery settings. It showed 2 hour, 13 minutes until fully charged. Ok, lets try the included charger and cable. I setup the included charging rig and the charging time was reduced to 42 minutes. Sweet!... until it wasn't. With the phone fully charged, I went to unplug the charger only to find it stuck in the phones usb port. No amount of wiggling in any direction would free it. Time to turn to Google for a solution. Not much help there other than someone suggesting sending the phone in for charging port replacement after suggesting the fast charger combined with a cheap cable may have allowed an arc to form in the port effectively \"welding\" the cable to the port. Panic set in as I resumed the wiggling process. I finally decided to pull harder and dislodge it, whatever the outcome. It came out finally. I plugged in my \"good\" cable and it showed \"charged\" so I knew it was working. I quickly disposed of the cheap usb cable so it could cause to more harm. Crisis averted.I can tell that the signal reception is much better than I had with my old phone. My old phone had good early morning reception where I work but it was shut down at 9:30 A.M. for the rest of the day. I was happy to see that was no longer the case with this phone. I had useable signal even inside the building. That in itself is huge to me.This a is a large phone. I work construction and wear carpenter jeans (with the pocket on the right leg) and all my previous phones slid right in that pocket with a slim case. This phone will barely fit naked. With the case I bought for it, it won't even begin to fit. Luckily the Unicorn Beetle Pro case has the belt clip so I can still carry it while at work... although I'm not a fan of the belt clip method. The case is very protective but makes the phone even huge(er). I have a slim case on order.The phone itself is fast, responsive and beautiful with more bells and whistles than any phone I've owned to date. It's going to take some time to start learning the tips and tricks that make this phone stand out from the crowd, otherwise it's a waste of this phones \"talent\". I'm hoping my luck and the longevity of the phone will keep this as my daily driver for years to come as Samsung has promised four generations of One UI and Android OS upgrades.(tl:dr) It's a big glorious phone sent safely at a good price. IMO... if you can swing the price, don't hesitate.", "date_posted": "2022-11-25", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DAHGKWPY2DMZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7JLUOsqO2pMLHLgTMRIdofuN07q38F1oGegdm45aT31hrFh9TClyZLOtAhRKbqWZ35n3tJWXvv6gd0r2bil1uJI67gKT_5pNypkNAwzrKbqcCgji2T8y2x-UfoM7a9MI7G24hCPpk6Wja2lMSOYXnbAwTPUrMsNLQScY5Gu6nbPUtNhNa74WLmzDBSJVIjHuOYApS1pO8VRPXuxIqtHvdYazi1I6twlEAcOLcm50Lig.ifdW4UZsmNzYzr-OOM46OpOmGGzucAZCRUdG1HS17Lc&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy+s22+ultra&qid=1734377870&sprefix=galaxy+s22+ultra,aps,83&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 364, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra", "product_id": 14, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MJTUK8PO6WZ2/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VD33WHW", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "Seems loose inside:Phone seems to work fine, but makes a weird noise if you shake it like something is rattling around inside", "date_posted": "2024-12-12", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DAHGKWPY2DMZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7JLUOsqO2pMLHLgTMRIdofuN07q38F1oGegdm45aT31hrFh9TClyZLOtAhRKbqWZ35n3tJWXvv6gd0r2bil1uJI67gKT_5pNypkNAwzrKbqcCgji2T8y2x-UfoM7a9MI7G24hCPpk6Wja2lMSOYXnbAwTPUrMsNLQScY5Gu6nbPUtNhNa74WLmzDBSJVIjHuOYApS1pO8VRPXuxIqtHvdYazi1I6twlEAcOLcm50Lig.ifdW4UZsmNzYzr-OOM46OpOmGGzucAZCRUdG1HS17Lc&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy+s22+ultra&qid=1734377870&sprefix=galaxy+s22+ultra,aps,83&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 365, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra", "product_id": 14, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CK8PDIYD25K5/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VD33WHW", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Coo:i got the \"excellent\" refurbished s22 ultra.i can see where maybe the previous owner may hav dropped it on the corner, and maybe cracked the screen, idk tho, everythings been fixed, but its barely noticeable, especially with a case on it.phone looks brand new. speed is waay faster and display is brighter than my note9. slightly bigger, a little heavier. less slippery.i tested out the 4 cameras, ultra-wide, 1x, 3x and 10x looks good.no cracks or scratches.the S-pen is legit. has Bluetooth. button works.always check the S-pen.phone upgrades to android 14 which has some AI features, which is interesting, but i probably wont use em.and it does have 5G Ultra Capacity for Tmobile.my Note20 had \"5G\" also but it was the Ultra wide band, that was slow and useless.Ultra Capacity is better.thanks gadgetdeals up in Washington \ud83d\udc4d", "date_posted": "2024-11-14", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DAHGKWPY2DMZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7JLUOsqO2pMLHLgTMRIdofuN07q38F1oGegdm45aT31hrFh9TClyZLOtAhRKbqWZ35n3tJWXvv6gd0r2bil1uJI67gKT_5pNypkNAwzrKbqcCgji2T8y2x-UfoM7a9MI7G24hCPpk6Wja2lMSOYXnbAwTPUrMsNLQScY5Gu6nbPUtNhNa74WLmzDBSJVIjHuOYApS1pO8VRPXuxIqtHvdYazi1I6twlEAcOLcm50Lig.ifdW4UZsmNzYzr-OOM46OpOmGGzucAZCRUdG1HS17Lc&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy+s22+ultra&qid=1734377870&sprefix=galaxy+s22+ultra,aps,83&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 366, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra", "product_id": 14, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KTQD6IPRI8PW/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VD33WHW", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "Bonito:Es un buen tel\u00e9fono, no le doy las 5 estrellas porque tra\u00eda unos peque\u00f1os rasgu\u00f1os en los lados pero lo dem\u00e1s ven\u00eda como nuevo, basto poner el case de tel\u00e9fono para que se viera como nuevo.

The software updates from Verizon from August - October 2022 helped with the stability of Android 12 and I no longer have random crashing or freezing of apps such as Google Maps, Microsoft Outlook or YouTube. The screen is brilliant, the S Pen fantastic. My last Galaxy smartphone was the S5, so many things have changed in terms of Samsung's design philosophy and user-friendliness. As a mini computer, the S22 Ultra definitely satisfies with Samsung DeX, the S Pen, Samsung My Files to connect to Network Storage drives, easy Print-to-PDF functionality in almost every app, customizable Edge Panel menus, an under-display fingerprint sensor, and reverse wireless charging.Cons:The S22 Ultra camera image quality, even though being 108 Megapixels, has a LOT of graininess in indoor lighting conditions, forget low light. The photo quality is NOT any better than my iPhone 6S Plus with 12 megapixels. It is, in fact, about the same or less clear as the 2022 Lenovo M10 tablet's 8 megapixel camera. I am not sure if that's due to it being a refurbished product or because that is the reality of Samsung S22 Ultra. I can occasionally get strikingly clear, low grain photos when outside in bright, sunny conditions, but it's not consistent. Sometimes even outdoor, sunny photos are speckled from over contrast, and I can see pixel blocks easily. 4K video also looks better when recorded from ANY iPhone 6S to 13 Pro.Tin-can like speaker sound, curved edges making it difficult to use the S pen with the Lasso tools in Samsung's Smart Select feature, and incompatibility with Mac OS Photos v. 4 (I just copy the image files to a Network Drive instead of connecting a USB cable to the Mac, and I suspect it'd work better if I used a more current OS/version but I cannot upgrade due to still needing software in Mac OS X Mojave).If the camera image quality were better and it had less curved sides, this would be probably be a 5-star product.

I am amazed at how I got my phone in the condition it came in . it said excellent condition , and it really is . I am really picky with my electronics , always wanting them to look perfect , no scratches or bumps . and this did not fail me. no scratches at all on the screen and maybe some small ones in the back that you really had to look for but with a case on its not an issue. cameras were also not scratched and everything works, from the cameras , to the speakers and the whole software of the phone is good and up to date. the only flaw, was how it had 88% battery life. on the description it says that having up to 80% will still land it on excellent condition , so I can't knock a point because I knew, and getting a new battery will be about 90$ according to apple. I did talk to one of my buddies that works on phones and said he doesn't recommend me to replace the battery as it still is healthy. and I have been using it for a week and it really doesn't need one. I had an iPhone 12 and I used it almost every day at work playing videos on the background , and it would last me about 7-8 hours and then id have to charge it considering my work days are 10 hours. with this phone , I literally come out of work with about 40-65% battery still.all it all , this is great , it was one of the best prices I could find for a used iPhone 13 Pro Max and im am actually really satisfied with my purchase . I also stayed with the 13 instead of the newer ones because it has a SIM card tray still and because it does not have the dynamic island that the new ones have as I think it takes up more screen when watching videos compared to the small notch on the 13. I wish it did have the stabilizing camera feature for when I walk my dog and want to take stable videos , but I don't mind that . this phone when it came out was beloved by every one and I think its still a great buy for 2024.", "date_posted": "2024-04-04", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max/dp/B09LPDM924/ref=sr_1_1?crid=U5SCRGI0S4C6&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.5nP8Q6fH282x2w-pRw63OCJds_QDweqbR0iFPGAeDaTCpFaoBU6AWLFyRpug88uHo-VdZi2Y-F7WaxZz4ov7IoQqjH1wmZgVP15PI7jVOBwP4txa5lQWDxXaySg9_AccPHSmKLS2VN_UxTyqpKUuna-_htLNZmYz5J_epHumbYssGECjgKqEvq6Hlv9LEoaJ7vkDB5iGrR3g0pGCtpAhLFyg-gQAigYimuhWon5LKsk.4iQT19Fe9xNEhcqHuKDvazX5M1x7tPBORGGqNwVAsYM&dib_tag=se&keywords=iphone 13 pro max&qid=1734377977&sprefix=iphone 13 pro max,aps,107&sr=8-1", "brand_name": "Apple"}, {"id": 388, "product_name": "Apple iPhone 13", "product_id": 15, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHB6UQED1YUSF/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09LPDM924", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "Great price -13 pro max:I have had my 13 pro max for about a month. overall I am very happy with the purchase.  the only negative is it came with 3 or 4 scratches on the screen, one deep enough that a fingernail can feel (amazon's \"good\" rating says no screen scratches are on the screen at that rating).

The A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth and snappy performance, and the camera system delivers exceptional image quality. The display is stunning with its vibrant colors and high resolution, providing an immersive viewing experience. The device's build quality is excellent, as expected from Apple, and the design is sleek and premium.However, coming from an iPhone 12 Pro Max with a battery health of 83%, I was hoping for better battery performance with the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that the battery health of my new device was also at 83%. Considering the hefty price tag of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, I expected a better battery health out of the box.That being said, the iPhone 13 Pro Max does offer a longer-lasting battery compared to its predecessor. With moderate usage, I can comfortably get through a full day without needing to recharge. I hope that this battery health issue doesn't lead to the same battery problems I encountered with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, where it struggled to hold a charge effectively.Aside from the battery health concern, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a powerful and feature-rich device that caters to the needs of tech enthusiasts and professionals alike. The improved performance, exceptional camera capabilities, and stunning display make it a top contender in the smartphone market.In conclusion, the iPhone 13 Pro Max offers an overall positive experience with its impressive performance and features.

Ultimately they said it's either a firmware issue or there is a remote possibility it's hardware problem. I performed update and restore from iTunes and the problem appears to be fixed now.I will keep testing over the next 90 days and decide if return the item or keep it.

I refuse to pay for a gift so I got myself a cheap phone for the time. Now I got this phone. It\u2019s supposed to be excellent quality\u2026 But the speaker on this phone is nowhere near as good as my other iPhone 13 Pro Max with 1tb that Mr hatefulness got me but refuses to pay for. I use that phone on WiFi and listen to my music on that phone at home but when I get away from the signal I\u2019m stuck with a crappy speaker phone. \ud83e\udee8 I guess I expected excellent quality instead of just good quality speaker since I paid for excellent quality phone. Crazy that my old phones speaker works so much better. All in all it\u2019s a great phone I\u2019m just really into music which is why I got the phone with the 1tb memory.

It's about the same/bigger physical size as my old iPhone 8 Plus (with a case on the 8 Plus) -- and so holding the new iPhone 13 Pro Max is like same in the hand for me -- but with the better iPhone 13 Pro Max. Easy to transfer apps & settings & data etc to the new iPhone. Bought this \"Renewed\" iPhone as \"Refurbished - Excellent\" from amazon marketplace seller MOBILESUPPLY whose 99% positive rating gave me the confidence that the condition of this iPhone 13 Pro Max would indeed be excellent & be like almost new. (NOTE: you have to dig into the amazon listing for this iphone to scrutinize all the sellers selling via this amazon iphone listing.) Anyways received in two days via fed-ex and got this beautiful iPhone that looked very much almost like new. According to the iphone's settings app, battery maximum capacity was 87% which is still good -- also connecting to the 3UTOOLS utility on my computer says battery actual capacity is 3727mAh (down from the original design capacity of 4325mAh) with an accumulated 694 re-charge cycles -- and therefore I'll have to eventually look into getting the battery replaced. There was a warning notice alert in the settings app which (incorrectly?) said unable to determine if the camera is a genuine Apple part -- ALTHOUGH the camera works fine and the 3UTOOL's verification report says the cameras check out as normal -- therefore I'm taking that warning alert as incorrect -- anyways many other users in various apple forums have been complaining about getting this incorrect message after updating to iOS 17.x.x despite never replacing any parts in their iphones -- fortunately this incorrect notice alert is suppose to go away after 15 days. So the camera checks out as genuine according to 3UTOOLS and the camera works fine. Playing music & video are great -- turn up the sound and it is loud. And calls & texts work great also. My regular apps all seem to also work fine. So I am Very Happy with this iPhone. Thanks AMAZON & MOBILESUPPLY.P.S. Discovered & finally noticed this iPhone 13 Pro Max has a tempered glass screen protector on it. That's a nice bonus.

From its stunning display to its powerhouse performance, this flagship smartphone truly stands out in the crowded market. Let me delve into the details of what makes this device a must-have, while also shedding light on an area that could use some improvement.First and foremost, let's talk about the display. The S21 Ultra boasts a breathtaking Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, delivering unparalleled clarity and vibrancy. Whether I'm streaming my favorite movies or gaming with friends, every visual detail pops with stunning realism. It's like having a cinema in the palm of my hand.Performance-wise, the S21 Ultra is an absolute beast. Powered by the latest Snapdragon processor (or Exynos depending on the region), coupled with generous RAM, this smartphone effortlessly handles multitasking, gaming, and productivity tasks with lightning-fast speed. Apps launch instantly, and I can seamlessly switch between tasks without any lag or stutter.One of the standout features of the S21 Ultra is its camera system. With a quad-camera setup including a 108MP main sensor, 10x optical zoom, and 100x Space Zoom, this phone lets me capture moments with astonishing clarity and detail. Whether it's a scenic landscape or a close-up shot, the photos turn out sharp and vibrant, even in low light conditions.The sleek design of the S21 Ultra is another aspect that I absolutely adore. From its premium build quality to its ergonomic feel in hand, Samsung has nailed the aesthetics of this device. It's a perfect blend of style and functionality, making it a pleasure to use and show off.However, no device is without its flaws, and in the case of the S21 Ultra, it's the included charger. While the smartphone itself supports fast charging up to 25W, the included 2.1A 10W ONLY charger feels somewhat underwhelming. In today's fast-paced world, where every minute counts, having a more powerful charger would significantly enhance the user experience, allowing for quicker top-ups on the go.", "date_posted": "2024-05-08", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-5G-Smartphone/dp/B096T6Y623/ref=sr_1_3?crid=21LMMUIYRDQU2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HGzzzHUL8bWb81yl2Sk9m_CwrahrbErELF02NZHkLQ13UWnQUyJQuIgiiAClpuBcGisu3X508LmDB0I0psdjFrBh64KRpbdZMHLJEfILTVLAyBb4kvfIawQmNpfDLk_Y4euItU360fXt6l3HVK9lrMa8eaCd_5rjknuhbz9kTbwyhwglSYvJnAAAoOt1_5w--yNe7D-MAU6eC1cKB_GAqHd2KrDfZKSqJpjnpJADOUY.Zu2dcZTziWxVzPdHnIM6Bp2n2RAj-RsFfvDQz5qqNqs&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy s21 ultra&qid=1734378014&sprefix=galaxy s21 ultra,aps,107&sr=8-3", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 437, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra", "product_id": 16, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDCYMUPB3VF1Z/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096T6Y623", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Good phone did its job:Camera is awesome 100x is unbelievable would buy again if it broke", "date_posted": "2024-12-08", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-5G-Smartphone/dp/B096T6Y623/ref=sr_1_3?crid=21LMMUIYRDQU2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HGzzzHUL8bWb81yl2Sk9m_CwrahrbErELF02NZHkLQ13UWnQUyJQuIgiiAClpuBcGisu3X508LmDB0I0psdjFrBh64KRpbdZMHLJEfILTVLAyBb4kvfIawQmNpfDLk_Y4euItU360fXt6l3HVK9lrMa8eaCd_5rjknuhbz9kTbwyhwglSYvJnAAAoOt1_5w--yNe7D-MAU6eC1cKB_GAqHd2KrDfZKSqJpjnpJADOUY.Zu2dcZTziWxVzPdHnIM6Bp2n2RAj-RsFfvDQz5qqNqs&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy s21 ultra&qid=1734378014&sprefix=galaxy s21 ultra,aps,107&sr=8-3", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 438, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra", "product_id": 16, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16KP2O0GOGN0L/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096T6Y623", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Excellent 2nd phone screen scratches:Ordered two s21 ultras replacing S8+.

Only issue is USC network for new phones is not their warp network, had to go back to lightspeed. Which is ok bc were on wifi mostly. Hubs phone has 5 small scratches on screen near buttons. Amazon wont give discount only choice is to return.. so \"excellent\" condition was not totally true for 2nd phone same seller. S8+ became unusable super slow always deleting videos or phone froze.

My car is about 5.5 inches off the ground, and due to how it slid out of my pocket and down my cars door frame it was essentially a drop of 5.5 inches and the front screen cracked and stopped working and the back cover shattered and started coming apart.

One example of this is that there were very mild scratches on the side of the camera bump, and while normally that would bother me a lot more, I didn't mind it too much since it wasn't effecting the phones performance, and I put a case over it anyway so I don't see them now. I inserted the sim card from my old phone and it all seems to work just fine with no issues that I am able to see as of this moment, though I hear stories of phones sometimes giving up on the sim card after about a month, so I will have to wait and see on that front. And finally I should say that I have always been incredibly skeptical of buying used phones in general, let alone online, but given the price of the phone and the fairly high standards I set for it I am really rather impressed.

I noticed a small scratch across one of the lenses but surely that doesn't impact the camera quality and focusing ability that much.

I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.", "date_posted": "2024-02-15", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung galaxy s24 ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung galaxy s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 528, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 17, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRL92WVBP7CLK/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "A Powerhouse with Stunning Display, Sleek Design and Exceptional Camera Quality:I've been using the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra for about two months now, and it's been a fantastic experience so far.

The 200MP camera is remarkable, capturing details and colors even in low light, which is perfect for anyone who loves taking photos.Performance-wise, it\u2019s incredibly smooth; apps open quickly, multitasking is seamless, and the battery life can easily last a full day, even with heavy usage.

At a minimum it takes great pictures and video. The screen is a great size for people with average to large hands. At first glance it looks like a standard ultra model its big, orbital lens separation, sturdy, bezel with a sleek design. I have been a Samsung fan since the galaxy line up started and practically owned every model out there to test and see which one is practical me the average joe. If you a minimalist this might not be the phone for you. This has the latest tech and probably will be overwhelming for you. This is due to the endless features that it has. If you are a gamer and have several hrs to kill on your favorite Mobile game this will meet your needs and then some. If you are that person that has been a Samsung note fan than this is the phone for you. If you're a movie junkie this will def suit your needs, when you're on a break from work or just hanging out. The color details are great especially in 4k. With this being said there are some quirks that i did not know existed and will pass it on to everyone. The s24 ultra has some drawbacks if you are purchasing it directly through Samsung. Your video calling will not work on with carriers - the reason for this Samsung does not have to voip it's a software according to Samsung. This is when you go to your contacts, and you have the option for video calling. This apparently cannot be put on by your carrier as they will deny trying to add it.(Samsung blamed the carrier , the carrier blamed Samsung) After several back-and-forth conversations Samsung told me to download a 3rd party app to allow me to video call. Other providers told me they could not help me. Now would you want to tell all of your contacts to download a 3rd party app and you would have to ask yourself \"would you do it for one person?\". Moving on to text messages and multimedia. You would normally be able pictures direct to people where it would show on the receiver's messages. But instead, it will send them a link that would expire in a certain time frame. They will then have to click to download the image to their phone. My question would be, how annoying that has to be every time i send someone a picture. They have to go through a ring of fire just to see the image or video. I have also asked about this with carriers they have stated, you guessed it go with a third-party app.  to the upside the phone is great. Standard android system as they have always been great but with a lot more at your disposal. Gpu is exceptionally fast (doesn't feel laggy or buggy) Camera is outstanding have taken countless photos with it. Videos are not grainy as some cameras from the galaxy line up once were. The phone is unlocked from Samsung. Bluetooth is great, connects fast and easy. Graphics are great for this model (does not overheat like the previous models when gaming) Overall if you want a phone that does the job this can do it. But do not purchase it directly from Samsung, purchase it through your carrier to avoid the hassles and dragged-out conversations i have gone through. I hope this helps you make your decision a little bit clearer on how you want to proceed on a new phone. I am giving it 3 stars from the manufacture. There was no recourse rectifying a solution. Also, for placing blame on another company and have me contact them, rather than Samsung trying to speak to the carrier direct that it also provides phones to.", "date_posted": "2024-07-18", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung galaxy s24 ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung galaxy s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 534, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 17, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L9JPYU9GJL1S/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "Bought it \"Used\" got lucky, came with box looked brand new:I've only owned every version of the Note series (now Ultra) since Note 4 (did not own the bendy screen one, just regular). So this is old hat, you either love this phone for its S Pen or just go with something else. I use my phone and the pen to make grocery lists, to do lists, draw, edit photos, etc.Pros:-FLAT SCREEN IS BACK. HOLY COW, how I've hated those stupid curved edges, glad that flat is back. Just bring back MicroSD expansion as well. I would say bring back headphones but apparently Android 10 or later killed external mic support via the combo jack. So, that's useless. This was the MAJOR reason why I upgraded my S23 Ultra, no joke, now I can put actual screen protectors on it, don't have to worry about optical glue-on glass that you then cure with UV.Cons:-Love that you can't turn off really annoying unnecessary notifications like the DAILYWELLNESS nonsense, weekly usage reports, \"hey we turned these apps off since you're not using them\".-Love that the galaxy store now has push notification ads that you can't turn off in settings or in app. That's super cool. Save that crap for your GALAXY A lines that are budget oriented, not your professional S lines.-New S Pen, now most of the time, the S-Pens that come with these are SERVICEABLE at best, but for whatever reason, this year's is painful to use, could be old age kicking in at 36 or just a bad design. It's too thin and too square. Last year's was slightly wider. NEVER MIND, just compared them, they're basically the same, it's the fact that last years had a rubberized texture on it, where this year's is just plastic, that's why it hurts to use.Meh:-A lot of this is more the same incremental improvements; cpu is beefier, display is brighter and more betterer, s pen is faster, touch is faster, etc. THE BORING STUFF.Overall:You always take a gamble with Amazon's \"USED\" stuff, and was worried that I was going to get a bad one. I bought, USED VERY GOOD, which usually means cosmetic damage somewhere on the device, and then it was \"USED VERY GOOD, potentially without box\". Mine looked pristine, slapped a screen protector and case on it right away to keep it that way, and it came with a box. You buy this phone if Samsung and styluses are your jam. OTHERWISE there's no real reason to get this. When there are a lot of companies with the 8 Gen 3 out there for a lot cheaper and in smaller more manageable body sizes. Like the S23 Plus or S23 standard.

I don't see a huge difference with the S24 ultra. It has a good camera with a good zoom which is important to me. It's now a 5x analog zoom instead of a 10x like the S23 but I don't notice a huge difference when it comes to zooming probably because the CCD chip is better at 50 megapixels instead of 12. It also does more digital manipulation with the picture afterwards which sharpens and cleans things up when zooming way in. I don't remember the S23 doing as much after you take the shot. I also notice a little bit brighter image when less light but that's probably because the CCD chip is a little larger to capture more light than the S23 ultra when it uses the 5x zoom lens. The biggest difference I see is the titanium instead of aluminum shell and it's nicer, it feels classier in your hands. I know the big hoopla is AI at the moment and Samsung is marketing it front and center, but it doesn't really make a big difference in my mind because the S23 with a firmware update has most of those features anyway. It is a refined highly powerful piece of equipment and a small step up from the S23 ultra from my experience so far.", "date_posted": "2024-09-06", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung galaxy s24 ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung galaxy s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 536, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 17, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22KUR1VEBNAFF/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Samsung galaxy s24 ultra:This phone is amazing  I buy it like few days ago  I been use it as well like they.say in review", "date_posted": "2024-12-10", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung galaxy s24 ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung galaxy s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 537, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 17, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EA4ILORMY1CG/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Love it:I found this on a black Friday sale and couldn't resist buying it.

I love this phone. It came packaged well. It came with a charger but not a wall port.  That's fine with me. I'm still learning the new features on this phone being that it has so many awesome features and also I read that this phone is rated better than the I phone 15 pro max . Sound quality is great. The battery last a very long time. I took this off of the charger at 8am. I had a movie playing . I took phone calls and texts and it's now 11.5 hours later and it's at 50% . 10 stars just for that !! Also I placed a glass cover over the screen and lens and redid my finger print and you'd never know that I had something that thick on my screen. It reads my print quickly.This phone also takes wonderful pictures.  You can also remove shadows or add object or people from pics from previous phones or the one that was taken from this phone . Pretty cool. Overall this has been thee best phone . I'm so glad that I didn't settle for the 22 ultra.

Before that I had a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus for 4 years, and before that was on iPhone since the iPhone 4. I don't play the android vs ios games, so if you're looking for that pointless narrative then go elsewhere. I'm writing this review to share my experience having throughly used both platforms.Apple has masterfully crafted a user experience that works just fine for most users. These people don't care about customizing or having an \"always on display\" that's actually always on. You have to be brainwashed not to admit that the iPhones AOD isn't really always on, no matter what settings you use. What iPhones has going for it is a finely tuned phone, texting, facetime, apple pay experience - things that make owning an iPhone convenient.What makes Android worth owning is the ability to use it how you wanted to use it instead of a corporation telling you you're \"holding it wrong.\" I enjoyed the galaxy s10. It had an excellent display, almost indistinguishable from the s24. My review will focus on the user experience/software of the S24, not the hardware. Hardware has gotten so powerful that most users will never need all that processing power.Samsung has failed to finely tune their software like Apple has. I liked s10's OneUI look - S24 is ugly in comparison. The stark blue and light grey quick menu has been replaced with an ugly \"Material You\" color pallet. You can download \"GoodLock\" and try to change the color palette, but countless things like transparency don't work with it. Bottom line is why I  would need to spend time trying to make it look decent if it's Samsung job considering the inflated price of these phones. So many things that should be included with the phone have been placed behind a paywall, forcing you to pay to get back what was part of OneUI in older versions.Another indication that Samsung isn't tuning its software is the fact that they gave up on their \"message\" app, now forcing you to use Googles message service, which is fine, but why bother having their own app if they never really committed to it?So many other system apps, Samsung has to confuse the user into deciding which platform to use. You will have double the apps for every single system app, again confusing the user into deciding in which service to commit to.I like Android, but I don't like Samsung. I don't see the point in spending a super premium price for a phone that's not fully committed to either own layer like ONEUI or Android. This has been the problem with Samsung phones since they released ONEUI. Either fully commit to your own version, or commit to stock Android - stop confusing consumers about what your product is about, and stop being scammy by holding back features behind a paywall.My recommendation for Android users is this: You don't need to pay a super premium price to get the Android experience. Today's budget phones are powerful enough to allow you to customize it according to your own liking.", "date_posted": "2024-10-14", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung galaxy s24 ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung galaxy s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 556, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 17, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVFBFZEI61IYI/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "Ease of setup:This item was very easy transfer all my information from my old Samsung S8 using Samsung Smart Switch app.  The camera picture quality is great, has alot of different editing tools included and so far the battery has a long life span (2 - 3 days) .The phone DID NOT come with a sim card (first Samsung phone that did not).

The screen color issue has been improved with a recent update (3/7/24)Hopefully all of the bad can be fixed with a software update but currently the phone is borderline unusable due to the extremely blue camera(s) white balance and lacking signal strength. I cannot understand how after ALL THIS TIME, Samsung seemingly doesn't test their flagship phone before manufacturing and shipping.As for the cameras, they're okay if the white balance wasn't green/blue and dark. My Note 20 from 3yrs ago takes nicer looking pictures but it's honestly difficult to tell if the cameras are any good because it's just so green/blue. If you edit each image one by one on an appropriate editor (not the built in one), you can get the images to look pretty good but a typical iphone 15 takes the same looking image without any editing. Reviewers are showing carefully shot images of scenes. General picture taking without much thought results in pretty bland/poor looking images you don't care to share. I really wish they would allow you to adjust at least the white balance settings in the camera app such that the images it takes are correct to what you desire by default.I don't know what to say about all the tech reviewers out there raving about this phone. Either they were given a completely different phone or they're all paid off. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone until Samsung addresses the ridiculous issues. I do believe all but the signal issue can be fixed with an update but that would require Samsung to admit there's an issue and then address it which seems to be difficult for them to do. The signal issue may even be able to be improved with a radio update but again, Samsung needs to admit there's something wrong which they don't want to.I absolutely hate Apple due to their requirement for you to live in their ecosystem but this will likely be my last Android if Samsung or someone else can't get their act together on such an expensive product.On a very very positive note, the antireflective screen on this phone is genuinely incredible. It's the single biggest upgrade imaginable. Unfortunately putting any screen protector ruins that feature so I'm just going to use it without a screen protector. The phone is worth buying simply for the antireflection. It's THAT BIG of a difference. I cannot understand why this isn't getting more attention. The darn signal strength issue is the single biggest deal breaker and so unfortunate and annoying. It's about ~15% worse than my 3yr old Note 20.", "date_posted": "2024-02-03", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung galaxy s24 ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung galaxy s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 565, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 17, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ87RVW0H4680/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "BEST OF THE BEST s24ultra:BEST of the Best s24 ultra", "date_posted": "2024-12-05", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung galaxy s24 ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung galaxy s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 566, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 17, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36LI8QLXI553X/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "S24  Great Phone  Tracfone compatible.:I purchased this phone to replace a low end Tracfone (J3 Samsung).

Or you can circle something on the screen and it will search for that.  Or it will translate text on the screen which can be really useful.  I am particular about how my home screen looks so I really like the feature that can generate an ai picture and use the color palette from the picture to use for the phone theme colors and it can also automatically redo those gawdy standard android icons to ones that look nice with the current wallpaper.  I like the new messages app that works better with those pesky iphone users :). The camera is of course awesome as well as the zoom.  Speakers sound better than my old phone and the battery life is better too.What I dislike most is the sharp corners, they are uncomfortable even with a phone case on.

I bought this phone based on the description that it was \u201cexcellent refurbished\u201d condition, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m giving this a 1-star rating: 1. Overheating Issues: The phone gets hot very quickly during basic use, even when just browsing or texting. It\u2019s uncomfortable to hold and concerning for long-term use. 2. Battery Life is Terrible: Despite the description claiming the battery was at 98%, the phone drains ridiculously fast. I can barely make it through a few hours before needing to charge again. For a phone advertised as \u201cexcellent,\u201d this is unacceptable. 3. Scuffed Camera: The camera has visible scuffs on it, making it seem like no effort was made to refurbish or inspect the phone properly before selling it. 4. Battery Cycles Misleading: The phone already had 128 cycles, which isn\u2019t what I would expect from a battery advertised as nearly new. This level of wear should have been disclosed upfront. 5. Stuck Without Options: I can\u2019t go without a phone, so now I\u2019m stuck with a subpar device in a predicament I didn\u2019t sign up for.This was supposed to be a reliable, refurbished phone, but it feels like I\u2019ve been sold something far from \u201cexcellent.\u201d I\u2019m very disappointed with this purchase and would strongly recommend others avoid this seller.

I clicked the S Pen and it would not come out. My friends showed me theirs and they clicked out easily. It was at this point I noticed there was slight damage to the bottom corner housing of the phone that could have caused binding on the S Pen and was entirely unwilling to investigate further.I took a short video showing the condition of the phone, explaining the issue, demonstrating it, and boxed it back up for return.

When smartphones became a thing, I like using the Samsung Galaxy Note line because the stylus always gave me an edge with an extra means to quickly jot down information.  I was sad to hear that they got rid of the Note line, but am very happy that they included the Stylus on the Ultra version of the Samsung Galaxy S23.  For those people who are unfamiliar the stylus allows you to take a quick note on the blank \"closed\" screen and has Bluetooth functionality that I personally use to activate the camera and take a photo.  Another added feature that not too many people seem to utilize is the DEX functionality.  This feature allows you to use your phone as a computer when you connect a Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse.  This is done (usually) by using a USB c to HDMI type adapter or dock.  This alone is amazing for me because I am able to use my phone as a dedicated desktop while traveling.  You can not use Windows or Apple programs as far as I know; you are limited to the apps that are available on the app store (both Google's and Samsung's).

That's how good it is. Anyway. This phone has been said by reviewers to be the best in the world and I agree.Premium quality. Perfectly renewed. Felt new. They even threw in a charger when the original doesn't come with one.Great value. Saved 266. The screen is huge but still ergonomic. The speed is incredible with 12gb of ram. I'm a ram head so I went for the 512 of storage just for that. Wished they offered that with the 256 version to save a few extra bucks but it'll be nice to have all this memory.The biggest and most amazing feature is the 10x optical zoom. I can't believe how good it is. The stabilization and quality is impressive and perfect.It's easy to use but for advanced users who theme it and change launchers, it's highly customizable which is why I go for Samsung and goodlock.Great buy. Happy to have spent all that money on a phone. Pairing it with an otterbox slim case and waiting ony new Mous case to come in.Go renewed. It saves money and is yet to disappoint.

The process can be troublesome for people who may not know what to do if they come across it.Overall, owning an iPhone for the first time has been a great experience, I was debating on getting the S24 Ultra from Samsung because I\u2019ve already owned one.

My wife on the other hand has an Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and likes Apple products. This is my first Apple smartphone. This review is about the condition of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max that I purchased from this seller. I will not say much about the smartphone itself as there are many other reviews on it.The seller advertised the item as renewed and in excellent condition. I received the smartphone in 4 days which was a nice surprise because the original estimated delivery date was 7-10 days. The iPhone package came in a plain white box (not the original Apple box) and included a generic lightning to USB-A charging cable. Nothing else is included. FYI, Apple did not include a charger with the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Out of the box, I inspected the item very carefully and up close. It looked just like brand new. Looking from closer than 12 inches, there were no scratches, dents, or nicks anywhere. I did find two very small paint chips on one corner edge of the outer steel frame. One paint chip was about 1/16 inch in size and the other was even smaller than that. From 12 inches away, the paint chips are barely noticeable but I can see them. A cell phone case will cover them up anyway so it's not an issue for me.I fully charged up the iPhone and turned it on. It booted up right away and I went through the setup process and connected it to my wi-fi router. I called my service provider, T-Mobile, and provided the necessary information to transfer the service to my new phone. I had a slight hitch where I could not make phone calls. I found out that I had to click setup in the cellular setting. Once I did that, I was connected to my service provider. Phone calls then went through without a problem. Also, I was able to pair my generic earplugs via Bluetooth very easily and quick.The renewed iPhone shows the battery health maximum capacity to be at 92% relative to when it was new. That is very good. Daily, I have used many apps, checked emails, made phone calls/texting, taken photos/videos, etc., and found minimal battery drainage. I can probably go a few days without recharging.The Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is bigger and heavier than my previous Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone so that is something you may consider if size and weight are an issue.All in all, I love the Apple iPhone Pro Max and I can say this is a good and honest seller.", "date_posted": "2024-06-30", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-128GB-Deep-Purple/dp/B0BN9P1GXC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2SGXO7PFXHMPE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QphN_BiRpyEcCWoUfCc4zkliqgrz21z7azzGk3CjyaD0Oj3xvnfMWk745OCQlq_5-XXfD7p9O25TfMO73C00pRALATdkx2ETFpSkUvt0wuzYikAz7wgehFyINpM1NWriLbgmxL40L4r8DlNH81njZu0Ml0dW5S3hPdrAuG4TZiHGvauVJIAaWeA-lkyYAFdNW4uXYiFl2hId8yVMoO0cLEIB973b3Q2KZ-2FY0-9iUk.idRIBjrs94wTzob6Qssk8wteh29ZKGzy3kHXkShL0mw&dib_tag=se&keywords=iphone 15 pro max&qid=1734376971&sprefix=iphone 15 pro max,aps,114&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Apple"}, {"id": 771, "product_name": "Apple iPhone 14", "product_id": 18, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OKI9Y2NADH8A/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BN9P1GXC", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "awesome, 100% recommend:this phone was in excellent condition, it was basically brand new. the battery health is at 100%, there\u2019s no scratches or dent or dings, i\u2019m extremely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend to a friend", "date_posted": "2024-12-09", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-128GB-Deep-Purple/dp/B0BN9P1GXC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2SGXO7PFXHMPE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QphN_BiRpyEcCWoUfCc4zkliqgrz21z7azzGk3CjyaD0Oj3xvnfMWk745OCQlq_5-XXfD7p9O25TfMO73C00pRALATdkx2ETFpSkUvt0wuzYikAz7wgehFyINpM1NWriLbgmxL40L4r8DlNH81njZu0Ml0dW5S3hPdrAuG4TZiHGvauVJIAaWeA-lkyYAFdNW4uXYiFl2hId8yVMoO0cLEIB973b3Q2KZ-2FY0-9iUk.idRIBjrs94wTzob6Qssk8wteh29ZKGzy3kHXkShL0mw&dib_tag=se&keywords=iphone 15 pro max&qid=1734376971&sprefix=iphone 15 pro max,aps,114&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Apple"}, {"id": 772, "product_name": "Apple iPhone 14", "product_id": 18, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU32X1DYAX6LL/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BN9P1GXC", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Looks good:It looks very new to me and the battery life is 88% but other than that I have tried it working good and it\u2019s worth the price you paid for it!", "date_posted": "2024-11-21", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-128GB-Deep-Purple/dp/B0BN9P1GXC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2SGXO7PFXHMPE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QphN_BiRpyEcCWoUfCc4zkliqgrz21z7azzGk3CjyaD0Oj3xvnfMWk745OCQlq_5-XXfD7p9O25TfMO73C00pRALATdkx2ETFpSkUvt0wuzYikAz7wgehFyINpM1NWriLbgmxL40L4r8DlNH81njZu0Ml0dW5S3hPdrAuG4TZiHGvauVJIAaWeA-lkyYAFdNW4uXYiFl2hId8yVMoO0cLEIB973b3Q2KZ-2FY0-9iUk.idRIBjrs94wTzob6Qssk8wteh29ZKGzy3kHXkShL0mw&dib_tag=se&keywords=iphone 15 pro max&qid=1734376971&sprefix=iphone 15 pro max,aps,114&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Apple"}, {"id": 773, "product_name": "Apple iPhone 14", "product_id": 18, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ECWVAO1A12K0/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BN9P1GXC", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "86% Battery health - no scratches:Phone is performing well, no scratches at all, battery is at 86% unfortunately but other than that the quality is good!

nitpicking.:I received my iPhone 14 Pro Max in great condition. There are no visible dents, cracks, or scratches, aside from very minimal marks on the side-casing that are not even visible enough to photograph (extremely minimal wear).However, upon receiving the phone, I noticed there is a very visible amount of dirt around the screen, and especially in the top microphone. It\u2019s almost caked in there, and I\u2019ve been unable to clean it myself. It seems as if the screen was replaced without the inner rim being cleaned first. It wasn\u2019t a deal breaker, but it definitely ruins the experience of opening a \u201cnew\u201d product and seeing dirt. I would expect this from a grade lower than excellent.The only reason it\u2019s getting four stars is the dirt. Cleaning should be a priority equal to functionality, and surely costs less than new parts. Other than that, the phone was correctly carrier locked, arrived quickly, and had a battery life of 97%. It also appears to have brand new back glass, which is nice.I\u2019m overall happy with the condition of the device.

This isn't my first refurbished phone, but I'm always a little anxious spending the money on something I HOPE is going to be good (as opposed to brand-new/unused).I bought this phone in refurbished/excellent condition. After reading multiple reviews on multiple refurbished phone listings on Amazon, my biggest concern was (always is) getting one with a damaged screen, cameras, or having it not truly be unlocked. I've had this phone less than 24 hours, but here's my take SO far (I can't speak for other people, these are just my experiences):1) Yes, it was (for me) truly, 100% unlocked. Not even an ex-carrier logo when I first turned it on! (My previous 'unlocked' refurbished phone has a T-Mobile logo when turned on) I was quite happy/impressed about this.2) No scratches (that I could see) on the front/touchscreen. There are multiple, TINY scuffs on the sides (not part of the touchscreen)/top edge/bottom edge of the phone - which I fully expected w/ a refurbished phone, and I'm totally fine with it (and this is if I'm REALLY nitpicking - they're really not that bad, though. It's just not FLAWLESS, which - again - I'm fine with).3) 99% flawless on the backside - the ONLY thing I can see is a TINY scuff on the edge of one of the cameras (not the actual camera/glass screen itself), and this is cosmetic - it doesn't affect the quality of the camera (that I've noticed).4) S-Pen pops out like it should, seems to be fine.5) Charges just fine so far - both wireless and wired.6) Popped in my SIM card (US Mobile, uses T-Mobile network), and it worked instantly. No phone/SIM-related problems so far. Everything - and I mean everything (data, wallpapers, photos, Samsung Notes from my previous phone, sounds/ringtones, apps, folders, etc) - transferred from my old phone perfectly (Samsung Smart Switch app).7) Fingerprint reader works fine for me so far - and that's with a plastic-y (TPU?) screen protector that I put on it.I haven't noticed any real issues thus far - if anything changes, I'll update my review.OVERALL: For me, yes it's definitely worth the money. If you're considering it and you're on the fence (and I understand why you might be), I say go for it. I'm very satisfied, hopefully nothing changes in time. Buying refurbished is a great way (in theory, lol) to save money while still getting a phone you really want (I think they're normally way overpriced anyway). Shipping was great (got mine the next day!), no issues with packaging (very safe/secure), and the phone - while not literally FLAWLESS - still looks great, works great, and I look forward to using it for a long time to come!

I'm assuming the S Pen that came with the phone was an aftermarket pen or something. So in conclusion, if you run into the same issue, just buy a new S Pen from \"Samsung\" themselves! It fixed the issue for me!Shipping:Phone arrived immediately on the next business day (Monday), 3 days after ordering it (Friday).In the box:-Phone-Fast Adaptive Charger Base-Fast Charging CableUnboxing/ Initial Impression:Outstanding condition of the phone itself! Not a single scratch, not a single fingerprint (other than my own fingerprints after unwrapping it).

Which I did. So, after it updated to December's latest software.. I installed the SIM card. Works flawlessly. Sent and received phone calls/ texts/ etc.S Pen:Pen works great!Final words:If you're thinking about it... DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. Get the phone!

The phone looked brand new BUT I thought two of cameras looked a little scuffed, taking pics looked fine, turned out two lens had old worn lens protectors on them is why it looked ugly lol (others lens had none), under them was pristine lens. I charged the phone. Actually a few times since yesterday I have charged it. Battery life seems to very bad but researching settings for improvements. Have changed many but still learning. The charging seems a lot slower time too vs my old 20+. It will say 2 or 3 hours but my 4 year old phone will say an hour on same cord with a low battery even etc. and it bleeds battery faster than my older phone. But again need to play with more settings maybe. Researching. Might be a s22 problem from my reading but this could be more I'm not sure yet. Video, sound quality & everything looks amazing. Love all the settings, ringtones even everything is better lol. WiFi. I love the s-pen. Seems to work. It's beautiful. But haven't tested everything but what I have seems new. No issues putting my phone card in or transfering all data. I put an OtterBox on it and screen protectors. I didn't notice starches or impressions but I didn't look super close bc I wanted it protected.

The s9 is obviously old but it worked well so I figured I'd buy a newer version for personal use after my iPhone I had for 8 years finally died.What I was looking for in a phone:[  ] Ability to make calls/texts[  ] A great camera as I am constantly traveling and in nature and I don't like carrying an extra camera[  ] A large interface to view the photos I take.A few details in the beginning-The below issues have been present since getting my phone. I have just now became frustrated enough to write a review.-I have never dropped my phone more than 3ish ft (from hand to ground while sitting or standing), what I'd sat is normal wear/tear. These issues DID exist before, though I don't think dropping an electric ever helps it. I've never gotten my phone wet, too hot, plugged in to a non GFCI protected outlet, or hooked up to another computer where a data transfer cord could have transmitted a virus.-I run a paid VPN and use Firefox and duckduckgo-I live in a very metropolitan area where proximity to my cell providers towers are not an issue-I have a nice case I have had on the phone since purchasing and a screen protectorIssues[  ] Answering phone calls: what I feel like happens most often is that when I attempt to answer an incoming call I press the green answer button. Then the  phone will stop ringing and bring up what I'll call the \"in-session call\" screen but it never truly connects. It will stay stuck on this screen with no one able to hear each other for up to a minute. I have talked to people in person (the one I was trying to communicate with) and they will tell me that they were sent to voice-mail.[  ] Placing phone calls: when trying to place phone calls, sometimes my phone will ring once then a recording will tell me the person I am trying to reach is unavailable or the number I am trying to reach is not in service. I knew that these two reasons were not valid before but I had an experience when needing to reach 911 where I was told the number was not in service. I have also verified this by sitting next to people I am trying to call and seeing that the call never goes through.[  ] Microphone crackles if playing outloud or on speaker and will continue making the crackling noise until phone is restarted[  ] Camera is just way less detailed than I thought it would be. I heard great things about the clarity before buying. And, when looking at the physical phone, seeing how many lenses there are on the outside, one would think this phone could produce some quality shots. But every photo I take seems pixelated. I have tried to narrow it down to a specific lens by tweaking zoom and frame but I have located it the fix. This may be a software issue as the lenses aren't scratched[  ] The autocorrect function is pretty lousy. One of the 3 options usually happens: 1, a word that is spelled correctly will be autocorrected to something that doesn't make contextual sense. 2, the correct correction will be made but it will be conjoined with the following word after typing. 3, a word is spelled wrong bybthe operator but autocorrect never pics it up. Funny enough, this example happened while typing the previous sentence. I left it just to provide example and put it into the attached media section on the review.[  ] Screenshots don't always show up immediately in your photos. The photo app may need to be closed out of first and reopened.[  ] Thumb print: huge issue here...it only works about half of the time. I have now just began putting my password in every time. This is a first world complaint, but if it is a function of the phone I bought, it should work more than half of the time.[  ] Trying to place the mouse in a specific place in a paragraph can be a nightmare. The sensitivity and touch technology for the screen seems cheap. I know this isn't the case but it can seem like it will place your mouse everywhere but where you want it. I have similar issues when trying to highlight a specific word/portion in text while making edits.Some good stuff[  ] The screen is very large and crystal clear. Samsung was able to utilize a really large portion of the front screen all the way to the literal edge The phone is great for watching videos[  ] The phone itself is very sleek and good-looking[  ] The battery life is surprisingly good. The lifespan does seem to fluctuate day to day as my usage usually consists of calling and text (no social media). If you reach 5% life though the phone has about 1-2 minutes left, unlike the iPhone which seems to vary.All in all, the first thing I would have done differently is to not buy refurbished. And secondly, in my very narrow experience, I think Apple makes a better product. The security on Apples devices is a HUGE selling point for me as well. I haven't had a security issue with this device, but I have tested the security of other android devices.", "date_posted": "2024-06-17", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DAHGKWPY2DMZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7JLUOsqO2pMLHLgTMRIdofuN07q38F1oGegdm45aT31hrFh9TClyZLOtAhRKbqWZ35n3tJWXvv6gd0r2bil1uJI67gKT_5pNypkNAwzrKbqcCgji2T8y2x-UfoM7a9MI7G24hCPpk6Wja2lMSOYXnbAwTPUrMsNLQScY5Gu6nbPUtNhNa74WLmzDBSJVIjHuOYApS1pO8VRPXuxIqtHvdYazi1I6twlEAcOLcm50Lig.ifdW4UZsmNzYzr-OOM46OpOmGGzucAZCRUdG1HS17Lc&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy s22 ultra&qid=1734377870&sprefix=galaxy s22 ultra,aps,83&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 853, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra", "product_id": 19, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16VHX0ZC88BD4/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VD33WHW", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Love it!

The software updates from Verizon from August - October 2022 helped with the stability of Android 12 and I no longer have random crashing or freezing of apps such as Google Maps, Microsoft Outlook or YouTube. The screen is brilliant, the S Pen fantastic. My last Galaxy smartphone was the S5, so many things have changed in terms of Samsung's design philosophy and user-friendliness. As a mini computer, the S22 Ultra definitely satisfies with Samsung DeX, the S Pen, Samsung My Files to connect to Network Storage drives, easy Print-to-PDF functionality in almost every app, customizable Edge Panel menus, an under-display fingerprint sensor, and reverse wireless charging.Cons:The S22 Ultra camera image quality, even though being 108 Megapixels, has a LOT of graininess in indoor lighting conditions, forget low light. The photo quality is NOT any better than my iPhone 6S Plus with 12 megapixels. It is, in fact, about the same or less clear as the 2022 Lenovo M10 tablet's 8 megapixel camera. I am not sure if that's due to it being a refurbished product or because that is the reality of Samsung S22 Ultra. I can occasionally get strikingly clear, low grain photos when outside in bright, sunny conditions, but it's not consistent. Sometimes even outdoor, sunny photos are speckled from over contrast, and I can see pixel blocks easily. 4K video also looks better when recorded from ANY iPhone 6S to 13 Pro.Tin-can like speaker sound, curved edges making it difficult to use the S pen with the Lasso tools in Samsung's Smart Select feature, and incompatibility with Mac OS Photos v. 4 (I just copy the image files to a Network Drive instead of connecting a USB cable to the Mac, and I suspect it'd work better if I used a more current OS/version but I cannot upgrade due to still needing software in Mac OS X Mojave).If the camera image quality were better and it had less curved sides, this would be probably be a 5-star product.

This would be my third and they have always worked with the phones being unlocked upon arrival. Pop your Sim card in (if compatible) and you're ready to go. I docked a star (but only one because this has been consistent with every Amazon renewed phone alwaysvordered in good or excellent condition) because of physical damages on the phone. They're typically cosmetic so it's no big deal, but it does put a really negative impact on \"feeling like you got a new phone.\" I'm not too concerned about this personally, but (specifically with samsung) these type of damages typically voids any extended warrantee. That topped off with a slow charging concern because this Cable that came with the charger failed to high-speed charge. I hade a spare/ old usb-C  to usb-C High speed cable and a box so no big deal and speaking for box there's no charger box that came with it. These things all have their own specs so it'd be more ideal and reliable to come with one. Little inconveniences but worth mentioning for someone who's wondering what buying Amazon refurbished is like.

I'd done the research and decided on the Galaxy S22 Ultra (mostly for the phone capabilities) but wasn't willing to spend $1200, so I took a chance on a refurb unit. I've had it for a couple days now and I can say it was one of my better purchases.The phone arrived a day early, well packaged, and included the phone(w/37% battery charge), an adaptive fast charger, a cheap usb c charging cable, and sim removal tool. After close inspection, the phone showed no signs of prior ownership. It was in pristine condition just like new. It started right up and I got through the setup process. Being an unlocked phone,I figured I could just throw in my Cricket sim card and be ready to go. Cricket recognized the phone straight away, reminded me to turn on wireless calling, and I was back in business. Now let's get it charged up.I plugged in my OP6T usb c cable and powerpack out of habit and started messing with settings when I ran across the battery settings. It showed 2 hour, 13 minutes until fully charged. Ok, lets try the included charger and cable. I setup the included charging rig and the charging time was reduced to 42 minutes. Sweet!... until it wasn't. With the phone fully charged, I went to unplug the charger only to find it stuck in the phones usb port. No amount of wiggling in any direction would free it. Time to turn to Google for a solution. Not much help there other than someone suggesting sending the phone in for charging port replacement after suggesting the fast charger combined with a cheap cable may have allowed an arc to form in the port effectively \"welding\" the cable to the port. Panic set in as I resumed the wiggling process. I finally decided to pull harder and dislodge it, whatever the outcome. It came out finally. I plugged in my \"good\" cable and it showed \"charged\" so I knew it was working. I quickly disposed of the cheap usb cable so it could cause to more harm. Crisis averted.I can tell that the signal reception is much better than I had with my old phone. My old phone had good early morning reception where I work but it was shut down at 9:30 A.M. for the rest of the day. I was happy to see that was no longer the case with this phone. I had useable signal even inside the building. That in itself is huge to me.This a is a large phone. I work construction and wear carpenter jeans (with the pocket on the right leg) and all my previous phones slid right in that pocket with a slim case. This phone will barely fit naked. With the case I bought for it, it won't even begin to fit. Luckily the Unicorn Beetle Pro case has the belt clip so I can still carry it while at work... although I'm not a fan of the belt clip method. The case is very protective but makes the phone even huge(er). I have a slim case on order.The phone itself is fast, responsive and beautiful with more bells and whistles than any phone I've owned to date. It's going to take some time to start learning the tips and tricks that make this phone stand out from the crowd, otherwise it's a waste of this phones \"talent\". I'm hoping my luck and the longevity of the phone will keep this as my daily driver for years to come as Samsung has promised four generations of One UI and Android OS upgrades.(tl:dr) It's a big glorious phone sent safely at a good price. IMO... if you can swing the price, don't hesitate.", "date_posted": "2022-11-25", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DAHGKWPY2DMZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7JLUOsqO2pMLHLgTMRIdofuN07q38F1oGegdm45aT31hrFh9TClyZLOtAhRKbqWZ35n3tJWXvv6gd0r2bil1uJI67gKT_5pNypkNAwzrKbqcCgji2T8y2x-UfoM7a9MI7G24hCPpk6Wja2lMSOYXnbAwTPUrMsNLQScY5Gu6nbPUtNhNa74WLmzDBSJVIjHuOYApS1pO8VRPXuxIqtHvdYazi1I6twlEAcOLcm50Lig.ifdW4UZsmNzYzr-OOM46OpOmGGzucAZCRUdG1HS17Lc&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy s22 ultra&qid=1734377870&sprefix=galaxy s22 ultra,aps,83&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 875, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra", "product_id": 19, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MJTUK8PO6WZ2/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VD33WHW", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "Seems loose inside:Phone seems to work fine, but makes a weird noise if you shake it like something is rattling around inside", "date_posted": "2024-12-12", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DAHGKWPY2DMZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7JLUOsqO2pMLHLgTMRIdofuN07q38F1oGegdm45aT31hrFh9TClyZLOtAhRKbqWZ35n3tJWXvv6gd0r2bil1uJI67gKT_5pNypkNAwzrKbqcCgji2T8y2x-UfoM7a9MI7G24hCPpk6Wja2lMSOYXnbAwTPUrMsNLQScY5Gu6nbPUtNhNa74WLmzDBSJVIjHuOYApS1pO8VRPXuxIqtHvdYazi1I6twlEAcOLcm50Lig.ifdW4UZsmNzYzr-OOM46OpOmGGzucAZCRUdG1HS17Lc&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy s22 ultra&qid=1734377870&sprefix=galaxy s22 ultra,aps,83&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 876, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra", "product_id": 19, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CK8PDIYD25K5/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VD33WHW", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Coo:i got the \"excellent\" refurbished s22 ultra.i can see where maybe the previous owner may hav dropped it on the corner, and maybe cracked the screen, idk tho, everythings been fixed, but its barely noticeable, especially with a case on it.phone looks brand new. speed is waay faster and display is brighter than my note9. slightly bigger, a little heavier. less slippery.i tested out the 4 cameras, ultra-wide, 1x, 3x and 10x looks good.no cracks or scratches.the S-pen is legit. has Bluetooth. button works.always check the S-pen.phone upgrades to android 14 which has some AI features, which is interesting, but i probably wont use em.and it does have 5G Ultra Capacity for Tmobile.my Note20 had \"5G\" also but it was the Ultra wide band, that was slow and useless.Ultra Capacity is better.thanks gadgetdeals up in Washington \ud83d\udc4d", "date_posted": "2024-11-14", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DAHGKWPY2DMZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7JLUOsqO2pMLHLgTMRIdofuN07q38F1oGegdm45aT31hrFh9TClyZLOtAhRKbqWZ35n3tJWXvv6gd0r2bil1uJI67gKT_5pNypkNAwzrKbqcCgji2T8y2x-UfoM7a9MI7G24hCPpk6Wja2lMSOYXnbAwTPUrMsNLQScY5Gu6nbPUtNhNa74WLmzDBSJVIjHuOYApS1pO8VRPXuxIqtHvdYazi1I6twlEAcOLcm50Lig.ifdW4UZsmNzYzr-OOM46OpOmGGzucAZCRUdG1HS17Lc&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy s22 ultra&qid=1734377870&sprefix=galaxy s22 ultra,aps,83&sr=8-3&th=1", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 877, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra", "product_id": 19, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KTQD6IPRI8PW/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VD33WHW", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "Bonito:Es un buen tel\u00e9fono, no le doy las 5 estrellas porque tra\u00eda unos peque\u00f1os rasgu\u00f1os en los lados pero lo dem\u00e1s ven\u00eda como nuevo, basto poner el case de tel\u00e9fono para que se viera como nuevo.

The camera is absolutely amazing. It's lightening fast and never lags, freezes or any of that crap.

Anyway, love the phone!!!! and then all of the sudden...... the screen went black on me for no reason. It wasn't cracked or anything... so i thought, maybe it just died?  i didnt recall the battery being so low though.. well , even the charging circle didnt pop up when i plugged it in, BUT it vibrated. it also vibrated when i pulled the s pen out. ok, so the phone is on.... the screen isn't working... but why? there is no reason for the screen to be black... while attempting to unlock my old s10+ through Samsung mobile i , for whatever reason, clicked play sound to find my s22.. it didnt ring. why?!???! it is enabled to be found.. the location and everything was on. whats going  on? welllllllp. after trouble shooting and symptom checking i discovered that my motherboard is failing. and its a really common problem with the s22 ultra! so my favorite phone.... has a motherboard issue. I just hope i can get all of my data off of it, and i hope that everything is backed up. it flashed on for a few minutes and i synced back ups but I'm not sure it actually finished before the screen blacked out again, or if it continued while blacked out.. anyway, this really really sucks.

Despite the varying prices between the phone I purchased from BestBuy vs this specific listing, all other descriptions of the phone and condition were identical. I just trusted BestBuy more and dismissed the extra $350 as they were more reputable sources for electronics. What a mistake that was!The 2 day shipping turned into 8, having actually started shipment on day 7. When it finally arrived, setup took 2 hours. There were some noticeable issues that I dismissed as a bug in the latest update (wireless connectivity being sporadic and frequently disconnecting, S pen not being recognized when slotted in the phone, apps crashing or becoming unresponsive) and just reached out to BestBuy for the fifth time to request a refund on the shipping cost as they did not deliver on that service. This night, I was informed that there was a price drop to $967 prior to shipment and that I would be reimbursed the difference. This conversation carried on for 30 minutes until the agent became unresponsive for the remaining 40. All other agents I talked with that night refused to uphold this reimbursement for \"policy\" which is understandable but as this was now an accrued 7 hours pursuing refund for shipping and that had still not been granted, I GAVE UP. I couldn't take it anymore! As soon as that chat ended, I placed my order from here with 2 day shipping with hopes of receiving it by Friday so I could set it up and have the BestBuy phone ready for return by Saturday.It is now Friday night. The phone delivered this morning. Setup was SO MUCH FASTER taking less than 40 minutes including a full data transfer from the previous phone and it has presented no issues whatsoever! I should have just gone with this in the very first place!

From its stunning display to its powerhouse performance, this flagship smartphone truly stands out in the crowded market. Let me delve into the details of what makes this device a must-have, while also shedding light on an area that could use some improvement.First and foremost, let's talk about the display. The S21 Ultra boasts a breathtaking Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, delivering unparalleled clarity and vibrancy. Whether I'm streaming my favorite movies or gaming with friends, every visual detail pops with stunning realism. It's like having a cinema in the palm of my hand.Performance-wise, the S21 Ultra is an absolute beast. Powered by the latest Snapdragon processor (or Exynos depending on the region), coupled with generous RAM, this smartphone effortlessly handles multitasking, gaming, and productivity tasks with lightning-fast speed. Apps launch instantly, and I can seamlessly switch between tasks without any lag or stutter.One of the standout features of the S21 Ultra is its camera system. With a quad-camera setup including a 108MP main sensor, 10x optical zoom, and 100x Space Zoom, this phone lets me capture moments with astonishing clarity and detail. Whether it's a scenic landscape or a close-up shot, the photos turn out sharp and vibrant, even in low light conditions.The sleek design of the S21 Ultra is another aspect that I absolutely adore. From its premium build quality to its ergonomic feel in hand, Samsung has nailed the aesthetics of this device. It's a perfect blend of style and functionality, making it a pleasure to use and show off.However, no device is without its flaws, and in the case of the S21 Ultra, it's the included charger. While the smartphone itself supports fast charging up to 25W, the included 2.1A 10W ONLY charger feels somewhat underwhelming. In today's fast-paced world, where every minute counts, having a more powerful charger would significantly enhance the user experience, allowing for quicker top-ups on the go.", "date_posted": "2024-05-08", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-5G-Smartphone/dp/B096T6Y623/ref=sr_1_3?crid=21LMMUIYRDQU2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HGzzzHUL8bWb81yl2Sk9m_CwrahrbErELF02NZHkLQ13UWnQUyJQuIgiiAClpuBcGisu3X508LmDB0I0psdjFrBh64KRpbdZMHLJEfILTVLAyBb4kvfIawQmNpfDLk_Y4euItU360fXt6l3HVK9lrMa8eaCd_5rjknuhbz9kTbwyhwglSYvJnAAAoOt1_5w--yNe7D-MAU6eC1cKB_GAqHd2KrDfZKSqJpjnpJADOUY.Zu2dcZTziWxVzPdHnIM6Bp2n2RAj-RsFfvDQz5qqNqs&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy s21 ultra&qid=1734378014&sprefix=galaxy s21 ultra,aps,107&sr=8-3", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 928, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra", "product_id": 16, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDCYMUPB3VF1Z/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096T6Y623", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Good phone did its job:Camera is awesome 100x is unbelievable would buy again if it broke", "date_posted": "2024-12-08", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-5G-Smartphone/dp/B096T6Y623/ref=sr_1_3?crid=21LMMUIYRDQU2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HGzzzHUL8bWb81yl2Sk9m_CwrahrbErELF02NZHkLQ13UWnQUyJQuIgiiAClpuBcGisu3X508LmDB0I0psdjFrBh64KRpbdZMHLJEfILTVLAyBb4kvfIawQmNpfDLk_Y4euItU360fXt6l3HVK9lrMa8eaCd_5rjknuhbz9kTbwyhwglSYvJnAAAoOt1_5w--yNe7D-MAU6eC1cKB_GAqHd2KrDfZKSqJpjnpJADOUY.Zu2dcZTziWxVzPdHnIM6Bp2n2RAj-RsFfvDQz5qqNqs&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy s21 ultra&qid=1734378014&sprefix=galaxy s21 ultra,aps,107&sr=8-3", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 929, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra", "product_id": 16, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16KP2O0GOGN0L/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096T6Y623", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Excellent 2nd phone screen scratches:Ordered two s21 ultras replacing S8+.

Now I say nearly because it definitely had one or two things here or there that gave me iffy feelings at first. One example of this is that there were very mild scratches on the side of the camera bump, and while normally that would bother me a lot more, I didn't mind it too much since it wasn't effecting the phones performance, and I put a case over it anyway so I don't see them now. I inserted the sim card from my old phone and it all seems to work just fine with no issues that I am able to see as of this moment, though I hear stories of phones sometimes giving up on the sim card after about a month, so I will have to wait and see on that front. And finally I should say that I have always been incredibly skeptical of buying used phones in general, let alone online, but given the price of the phone and the fairly high standards I set for it I am really rather impressed. If anything I just mentioned happens to change sometime in the near future I will definitely come back and change my review accordingly but until then I will 100% recommend this phone for the price", "date_posted": "2024-05-14", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-5G-Smartphone/dp/B096T6Y623/ref=sr_1_3?crid=21LMMUIYRDQU2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HGzzzHUL8bWb81yl2Sk9m_CwrahrbErELF02NZHkLQ13UWnQUyJQuIgiiAClpuBcGisu3X508LmDB0I0psdjFrBh64KRpbdZMHLJEfILTVLAyBb4kvfIawQmNpfDLk_Y4euItU360fXt6l3HVK9lrMa8eaCd_5rjknuhbz9kTbwyhwglSYvJnAAAoOt1_5w--yNe7D-MAU6eC1cKB_GAqHd2KrDfZKSqJpjnpJADOUY.Zu2dcZTziWxVzPdHnIM6Bp2n2RAj-RsFfvDQz5qqNqs&dib_tag=se&keywords=galaxy s21 ultra&qid=1734378014&sprefix=galaxy s21 ultra,aps,107&sr=8-3", "brand_name": "Samsung"}, {"id": 961, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra", "product_id": 16, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PZDPAMEPZZLB/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096T6Y623", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "Wanted to love this phone but...:I really wanted to love this phone but there was one issue that I just couldn't get past & that was the camera.

I noticed a small scratch across one of the lenses but surely that doesn't impact the camera quality and focusing ability that much. My phone's camera doesn't seem quite as capable, again could be due to the fact it's renewed. And likewise the battery life seems to be less than half of what it was claimed to be. The phone body itself was pretty beat up but that's not a big deal since it was thrown straight into an OtterBox. I would say it gets the job done and you get what you pay for.

At 10x still gets great photos and will go up to 100 but that is almost unrecognizable. When I don't know how to do something I ask Google and get the perfect answer. Am not dropping calls like I did with a Motorola phone that was much less expensive. Here's hoping I have many years of enjoyment out of this phone and camera. Now July 25th and I am still completely happy with the phone and Camera. I've taken it on vacation and thrilled with the results. Would not know it was renewed at all. Still have till September to return it if I need to. What a deal.

However, when I went to turn in this beautiful powerful behemoth, I saw the dreaded At&T logo. After hours of fiddling with the sim card trying to get it to accept my at&t unlocking code, I finally got it to work (without putting in my code?). I managed to disable most of the at&t bloatware but it's still there alright and will probably haunt me. But it connected to Metro by T-Mobile just fine after a online transfer of IMEIs. It works perfectly, the fastest phone Ive ever owned and battery seems to be pretty darn good considering the age of the phone.

The phone looks great and works as expected. Unfortunately,  I'm not impressed with the battery life. I know overall the S21 battery is an issue but this one drains quickly. I'm going to hang on it for a couple more days and may have to return it. It drains to dead off in 5 to 6 hours.Update 5/12/24.....The battery life never improved. Battery got very warm during charging but thought I would just get battery replaced for $100 and not worry about shipping it back and getting credit and all that stuff. Last week I fell into a pool with phone in pocket and immediately pulled it out. Phone wouldn't turn on after that at all. Got it diagnosed for $45 and result was a cooked motherboard.
