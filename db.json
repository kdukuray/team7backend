I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.", "date_posted": "2024-02-15", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung+galaxy+s24+ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung+galaxy+s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1"}, {"id": 134, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 2, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRL92WVBP7CLK/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "A Powerhouse with Stunning Display, Sleek Design and Exceptional Camera Quality:I've been using the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra for about two months now, and it's been a fantastic experience so far.

At a minimum it takes great pictures and video. The screen is a great size for people with average to large hands. At first glance it looks like a standard ultra model its big, orbital lens separation, sturdy, bezel with a sleek design. I have been a Samsung fan since the galaxy line up started and practically owned every model out there to test and see which one is practical me the average joe. If you a minimalist this might not be the phone for you. This has the latest tech and probably will be overwhelming for you. This is due to the endless features that it has. If you are a gamer and have several hrs to kill on your favorite Mobile game this will meet your needs and then some. If you are that person that has been a Samsung note fan than this is the phone for you. If you're a movie junkie this will def suit your needs, when you're on a break from work or just hanging out. The color details are great especially in 4k. With this being said there are some quirks that i did not know existed and will pass it on to everyone. The s24 ultra has some drawbacks if you are purchasing it directly through Samsung. Your video calling will not work on with carriers - the reason for this Samsung does not have to voip it's a software according to Samsung. This is when you go to your contacts, and you have the option for video calling. This apparently cannot be put on by your carrier as they will deny trying to add it.(Samsung blamed the carrier , the carrier blamed Samsung) After several back-and-forth conversations Samsung told me to download a 3rd party app to allow me to video call. Other providers told me they could not help me. Now would you want to tell all of your contacts to download a 3rd party app and you would have to ask yourself \"would you do it for one person?\". Moving on to text messages and multimedia. You would normally be able pictures direct to people where it would show on the receiver's messages. But instead, it will send them a link that would expire in a certain time frame. They will then have to click to download the image to their phone. My question would be, how annoying that has to be every time i send someone a picture. They have to go through a ring of fire just to see the image or video. I have also asked about this with carriers they have stated, you guessed it go with a third-party app.  to the upside the phone is great. Standard android system as they have always been great but with a lot more at your disposal. Gpu is exceptionally fast (doesn't feel laggy or buggy) Camera is outstanding have taken countless photos with it. Videos are not grainy as some cameras from the galaxy line up once were. The phone is unlocked from Samsung. Bluetooth is great, connects fast and easy. Graphics are great for this model (does not overheat like the previous models when gaming) Overall if you want a phone that does the job this can do it. But do not purchase it directly from Samsung, purchase it through your carrier to avoid the hassles and dragged-out conversations i have gone through. I hope this helps you make your decision a little bit clearer on how you want to proceed on a new phone. I am giving it 3 stars from the manufacture. There was no recourse rectifying a solution. Also, for placing blame on another company and have me contact them, rather than Samsung trying to speak to the carrier direct that it also provides phones to.", "date_posted": "2024-07-18", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung+galaxy+s24+ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung+galaxy+s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1"}, {"id": 140, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 2, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU1VEDFGFJ4JK/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Powerhouse of a phone:I recently upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, and I can confidently say it\u2019s worth every penny.

Before that I had a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus for 4 years, and before that was on iPhone since the iPhone 4. I don't play the android vs ios games, so if you're looking for that pointless narrative then go elsewhere. I'm writing this review to share my experience having throughly used both platforms.Apple has masterfully crafted a user experience that works just fine for most users. These people don't care about customizing or having an \"always on display\" that's actually always on. You have to be brainwashed not to admit that the iPhones AOD isn't really always on, no matter what settings you use. What iPhones has going for it is a finely tuned phone, texting, facetime, apple pay experience - things that make owning an iPhone convenient.What makes Android worth owning is the ability to use it how you wanted to use it instead of a corporation telling you you're \"holding it wrong.\" I enjoyed the galaxy s10. It had an excellent display, almost indistinguishable from the s24. My review will focus on the user experience/software of the S24, not the hardware. Hardware has gotten so powerful that most users will never need all that processing power.Samsung has failed to finely tune their software like Apple has. I liked s10's OneUI look - S24 is ugly in comparison. The stark blue and light grey quick menu has been replaced with an ugly \"Material You\" color pallet. You can download \"GoodLock\" and try to change the color palette, but countless things like transparency don't work with it. Bottom line is why I  would need to spend time trying to make it look decent if it's Samsung job considering the inflated price of these phones. So many things that should be included with the phone have been placed behind a paywall, forcing you to pay to get back what was part of OneUI in older versions.Another indication that Samsung isn't tuning its software is the fact that they gave up on their \"message\" app, now forcing you to use Googles message service, which is fine, but why bother having their own app if they never really committed to it?So many other system apps, Samsung has to confuse the user into deciding which platform to use. You will have double the apps for every single system app, again confusing the user into deciding in which service to commit to.I like Android, but I don't like Samsung. I don't see the point in spending a super premium price for a phone that's not fully committed to either own layer like ONEUI or Android. This has been the problem with Samsung phones since they released ONEUI. Either fully commit to your own version, or commit to stock Android - stop confusing consumers about what your product is about, and stop being scammy by holding back features behind a paywall.My recommendation for Android users is this: You don't need to pay a super premium price to get the Android experience. Today's budget phones are powerful enough to allow you to customize it according to your own liking.", "date_posted": "2024-10-14", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung+galaxy+s24+ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung+galaxy+s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1"}, {"id": 146, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 2, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6DQ86UQ1682/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 5, "country": "United States", "content": "Excellent:Bought this for my daughter for her 15th birthday.

I really like having the pen which is the main reason I got it.  It has  a cool feature that I use quite a bit where you can hold down the home button and it will analyze whatever is on the screen or whatever you are pointing your camera at and then show you web results.  Or you can circle something on the screen and it will search for that.  Or it will translate text on the screen which can be really useful.  I am particular about how my home screen looks so I really like the feature that can generate an ai picture and use the color palette from the picture to use for the phone theme colors and it can also automatically redo those gawdy standard android icons to ones that look nice with the current wallpaper.  I like the new messages app that works better with those pesky iphone users :). The camera is of course awesome as well as the zoom.  Speakers sound better than my old phone and the battery life is better too.What I dislike most is the sharp corners, they are uncomfortable even with a phone case on.

So this is old hat, you either love this phone for its S Pen or just go with something else. I use my phone and the pen to make grocery lists, to do lists, draw, edit photos, etc.Pros:-FLAT SCREEN IS BACK. HOLY COW, how I've hated those stupid curved edges, glad that flat is back. Just bring back MicroSD expansion as well. I would say bring back headphones but apparently Android 10 or later killed external mic support via the combo jack. So, that's useless. This was the MAJOR reason why I upgraded my S23 Ultra, no joke, now I can put actual screen protectors on it, don't have to worry about optical glue-on glass that you then cure with UV.Cons:-Love that you can't turn off really annoying unnecessary notifications like the DAILYWELLNESS nonsense, weekly usage reports, \"hey we turned these apps off since you're not using them\".-Love that the galaxy store now has push notification ads that you can't turn off in settings or in app. That's super cool. Save that crap for your GALAXY A lines that are budget oriented, not your professional S lines.-New S Pen, now most of the time, the S-Pens that come with these are SERVICEABLE at best, but for whatever reason, this year's is painful to use, could be old age kicking in at 36 or just a bad design. It's too thin and too square. Last year's was slightly wider. NEVER MIND, just compared them, they're basically the same, it's the fact that last years had a rubberized texture on it, where this year's is just plastic, that's why it hurts to use.Meh:-A lot of this is more the same incremental improvements; cpu is beefier, display is brighter and more betterer, s pen is faster, touch is faster, etc. THE BORING STUFF.Overall:You always take a gamble with Amazon's \"USED\" stuff, and was worried that I was going to get a bad one. I bought, USED VERY GOOD, which usually means cosmetic damage somewhere on the device, and then it was \"USED VERY GOOD, potentially without box\". Mine looked pristine, slapped a screen protector and case on it right away to keep it that way, and it came with a box. You buy this phone if Samsung and styluses are your jam. OTHERWISE there's no real reason to get this. When there are a lot of companies with the 8 Gen 3 out there for a lot cheaper and in smaller more manageable body sizes. Like the S23 Plus or S23 standard. The Titanium Gray color has a slight champagne/earthen quality to the gray that I kind of dig that's subtle and sort of classy.", "date_posted": "2024-04-09", "associated_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W1NRUD1S0X0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nsyb0SF4p0uSwFcc8N5ap3DjsD-JuNuBY_xKo_moRG8djmqeu2LMEjuld3e_fYp7XFU41Iyht7DRcv7_NS7GunqSWm4YnnkgUDM02B-gz3rCg-76Hyxu2v7oNrlMn7yg8pI-0FxttODLhgdv2wcWTNC-DrFO9JHoGybFJ6xK4FBrbZ8NCKFHy_WthDxsovgMfDYHeZi5d7zQsFBxcGVdQid10UlMEvbCww1cfNNhG7wEzRY2rB_yaRUWrVl052G8ZViKJQmPaLkt6NnOhGuVxz9LqL0G8POneNT-m9cLiv79ZYkuseVQFyQ3KXIkdZMR2a1Kqq6NK0QeIpnTAumu5KquePlyWfUTdjX3LwNOpVc.uCP12NMd-GM9vweQv_AGVLwf_OdOxyblXXIbk8cyu1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung+galaxy+s24+ultra&qid=1734319803&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=samsung+galaxy+s24,amazon-devices,513&sr=1-1&th=1"}, {"id": 150, "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra", "product_id": 2, "review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C1TDKBSKR6T7/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDMKQB7", "score": 4, "country": "United States", "content": "Refined to a very powerful practical tool:I had the S23 ultra but ran it over by accident. I don't see a huge difference with the S24 ultra. It has a good camera with a good zoom which is important to me. It's now a 5x analog zoom instead of a 10x like the S23 but I don't notice a huge difference when it comes to zooming probably because the CCD chip is better at 50 megapixels instead of 12. It also does more digital manipulation with the picture afterwards which sharpens and cleans things up when zooming way in. I don't remember the S23 doing as much after you take the shot. I also notice a little bit brighter image when less light but that's probably because the CCD chip is a little larger to capture more light than the S23 ultra when it uses the 5x zoom lens. The biggest difference I see is the titanium instead of aluminum shell and it's nicer, it feels classier in your hands. I know the big hoopla is AI at the moment and Samsung is marketing it front and center, but it doesn't really make a big difference in my mind because the S23 with a firmware update has most of those features anyway.

I haven't had any problems with it. Everything that you think that you got with an iPhone, you got more with this Samsung. And yes, I did spend a pretty penny on this phone. However I think it was totally worth it from the customizable to the AI being installed in it to having all the Samsung feelings that make it feel like an actual smartphone. I absolutely love it. Customization is the best part of this phone. I can change it, however I want to. It's the same with an iPhone but I feel like you can do so much more with this phone now. I will say that the best part about this was the gestures that I can use on this phone. Whenever I'm trying to use my previous iPhone because it still has all my information on it, I just can't do the gestures anymore and it makes me feel like, \"Oh, that's not working in my favor,\" so I say that that is one of the best qualities and the best parts of the phone. But overall, The appearance feels amazing. It is very easy to use. The battery life is questionable. Because I tried to run it from 6am-11am and it's already down to forty percent, so I don't know what the context is. Maybe it's my own battery, but it still lasts a long time if you're not using it 24/7. The condition of the phone whenever I first got it was It felt like I just bought it from the store.

I haven\u2019t had to recharge it since last May 2024.

You also have the ability to use motion schedules to avoid getting alerts at certain times and days. The video quality is fantastic! I get alerts instantly when someone is approaching the front door.

Many reviews highlight the stunning displays, excellent camera capabilities, and strong battery life, emphasizing how these elements enhance both daily use and specific tasks like photography and gaming. Users transitioning from older models, particularly from the S Series, frequently remark on significant improvements, particularly in camera quality and speed. However, there are criticisms regarding the phone's high price point and some dissatisfaction with certain software aspects, particularly One UI, which some find less appealing compared to Apple's iOS experience. Additionally, initial frustrations around the lack of accessories in the box and issues with setup have been mentioned, albeit less frequently. Overall, while there are minor complaints, the S24 and its features have received strong endorsements from users looking for a high-end smartphone experience.", "average_rating": 4.64}]}
